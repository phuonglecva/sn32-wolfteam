Learning and memory changes were not observed after Al treatment of neonatal and immature rabbits, compared to the biphasic effect (enhancement after low doses, attenuation after high doses) seen in gestationally exposed rabbits and the attenuation observed in adult rabbits. Taken together, these results demonstrate prolonged effects of reduced body weight, impairment of bone formation, and tissue Al accumulation following Al exposure that are not readily reversed with termination of exposure. The results show that the immature rabbit is most susceptible to Al-induced skeletal toxicity and the mature rabbit most susceptible to Al-induced behavioral toxicity.",

The statute authorizes designated\n\nstate agencies such as ODRS to license and assign blind vendors to operate vending\n\nfacilities on federal property. It establishes an arbitration scheme to resolve disputes\n\narising from this program.\n\n       In accordance with the statute, the Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d) convened an\n\narbitration panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) to hear the grievances of David Altstatt, a blind vendor,\n\nchallenging ODRS\u2019s selection of another blind vendor, Robert Brown, for a particular\n\nvending assignment. Both Mr. Altstatt and Mr. Brown had applied for the assignment.\n\nThe Panel found for Mr. Altstatt and ordered ODRS to remove Mr. Brown from the\n\ndisputed assignment, appoint Mr. Altstatt in Mr. Brown\u2019s place, and pay damages and\n\nattorney fees to Mr. Altstatt.\n\n       ODRS brought suit in district court against DOE, seeking to vacate the Panel\u2019s\n\ndecision, which the Randolph-Sheppard Act subjects to judicial review as a final agency\n\n                                              2\n\faction under the Administrative Procedure Act (the \u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551 et seq. Mr.\n\nAltstatt intervened as a defendant and counterclaimant, requesting that the court affirm\n\nthe arbitration decision. DOE participated in the litigation only to the extent of filing the\n\nadministrative record of the Panel proceedings. The district court entered judgment in\n\nfavor of Mr. Altstatt and ordered ODRS to comply with the Panel\u2019s decision. ODRS now\n\nappeals.\n\n       Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the district court\u2019s\n\ndecision as to the Panel\u2019s award of injunctive relief in the form of Mr. Brown\u2019s removal\n\nand Mr. Altstatt\u2019s appointment to the disputed assignment, but we reverse as to the\n\nPanel\u2019s award of damages and attorney fees.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       This section provides background on: (A) the RSA, (B) Mr. Altstatt\u2019s grievances\n\nagainst ODRS, (C) the Panel\u2019s decision in favor of Mr. Altstatt, and (D) the federal\n\ndistrict court proceedings.\n\n                              A. The Randolph-Sheppard Act\n\n       The RSA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107 et seq., enacted in 1936 and amended in 1954 and\n\n1974, established a federal program (the \u201cRSA Program\u201d) to enhance blind individuals\u2019\n\neconomic opportunities by granting them priority to operate vending facilities on federal\n\nproperty. States participate in the RSA Program through state licensing agencies\n\n(\u201cSLAs\u201d) designated by the DOE, which administers the RSA. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 107a(a), 107(b).\n\nSLAs promulgate and implement policies and standards, which DOE must approve,\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fgoverning the licensure and selection of blind vendors to operate vending facilities on\n\nfederal property. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.4; see also id. \u00a7 395.3(a)(7).\n\n       As amended in 1974, the RSA establishes a two-tiered scheme for resolving blind\n\nvendors\u2019 grievances arising from SLAs\u2019 operation of the RSA program. First, SLAs\n\nmust hear and render a decision on a blind vendor\u2019s grievance. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-1(a).\n\nSecond, a vendor who is dissatisfied with the SLA\u2019s decision may then request arbitration\n\nby a panel convened by DOE. Id. RSA arbitration decisions are subject to judicial\n\nreview in federal court as final agency actions under the APA. Id. \u00a7 107d-2.\n\n                       B. Mr. Altstatt\u2019s Grievances against ODRS\n\n       ODRS, Oklahoma\u2019s designated licensing agency, issues licenses to blind vendors\n\nand assigns them to manage vending contracts with the federal government. See Okla.\n\nAdmin. Code \u00a7 612:25-4-1(a). In late 2012, ODRS initiated a selection process for a\n\nlicensed blind vendor to assume the management of the Fort Sill vending contract (the\n\n\u201cContract\u201d) with the Army. It solicited applications through a position announcement\n\n(the \u201cAnnouncement\u201d), which enumerated \u201celigibility criteria specific to this\n\nannouncement.\u201d App., Vol. 7 at 1135, 1139. To be eligible, the applicant must not \u201chave\n\nhad any delinquency on taxes for the past 3 years.\u201d Id. at 1139. In accordance with its\n\nregulations, Okla. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 612:25-4-57, 612:25-4-59, ODRS convened a\n\nselection committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) to interview the candidates, evaluate their\n\napplications, and make a recommendation for the Contract assignment. The Committee\n\nrecommended Mr. Brown over the other candidates, which included Mr. Altstatt. ODRS\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\faccepted the Committee\u2019s recommendation and selected Mr. Brown to manage the\n\nContract.\n\n       After Mr. Brown\u2019s selection, Mr. Altstatt filed a grievance with ODRS,\n\ncomplaining about the Committee\u2019s selection procedures. He argued that Mr. Brown\u2019s\n\nselection was null and void because the Committee had not considered a required scoring\n\nfactor under ODRS\u2019s regulations.1 ODRS, after a full evidentiary hearing, ordered the\n\nCommittee to reconvene within 30 days to consider the previously omitted factor. In the\n\nmeantime, ODRS appointed Mr. Brown as the interim Contract manager so that he could\n\nbegin preparations to operate Fort Sill\u2019s vending facility. ODRS also assigned each\n\ncandidate a score for the previously omitted factor based on the available data and\n\nprovided this information to the Committee. The reconvened Committee considered the\n\nadditional scores and again recommended Mr. Brown for the Contract assignment.\n\nODRS again accepted the Committee\u2019s recommendation.\n\n       Following ODRS\u2019s interim appointment of Mr. Brown and again after ODRS\u2019s\n\npermanent re-selection of Mr. Brown, Mr. Altstatt filed grievances with ODRS to\n\nchallenge these actions. He complained, among other things, that (1) ODRS\u2019s re-\n\nselection process was \u201cinfirm,\u201d App., Vol. 7 at 1227, (2) one of the Committee\n\n       1\n         At the relevant time, ODRS regulations provided that selection committees\u2019\nscoring of applicants \u201cshall be based on\u201d four \u201cfactors,\u201d one of which was called\n\u201c[m]onthly location reviews and annual evaluation.\u201d Okla. Admin. Code \u00a7 612:25-4-59\n(2012). Mr. Altstatt complained\u2014and ODRS does not dispute\u2014that the Committee\nfailed to consider the \u201cmonthly location reviews and annual evaluation\u201d factor. ODRS\nhas instead defended the omission of this factor by offering evidence to show that \u201cdata\nwas [not] available for [this factor] at the time that the . . . Committee needed to conduct\nth[e] selection process.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 10 (citing App., Vol. 6 at 1053-58).\n\n                                              5\n\fmembers\u2014Charles Pride\u2014was biased, and (3) Mr. Brown was ineligible for the Contract\n\nassignment because he was delinquent on his taxes. Mr. Altstatt also filed a complaint\n\nwith DOE to request arbitration of his grievances against ODRS.\n\n       ODRS granted Mr. Altstatt a second full evidentiary hearing. After the hearing, it\n\naffirmed Mr. Brown\u2019s interim and permanent appointments, concluding that they\n\n\u201ccomplied with the applicable regulations and due process.\u201d App., Vol. 4 at 718-19.\n\nDissatisfied with ODRS\u2019s decision, Mr. Altstatt filed a second complaint with DOE\n\nrequesting arbitration of his grievances.\n\n                                 C. The Panel\u2019s Decision\n\n       In July 2014, DOE notified the parties that it was consolidating Mr. Altstatt\u2019s\n\nrequests for arbitration and \u201cauthoriz[ing] the convening of [the Panel] to hear and render\n\na decision on the issues raised in the two complaints.\u201d App., Vol. 5 at 766, 768. DOE\n\nstated that \u201c[t]he central issue is whether [ODRS]\u2019s process for selecting a blind vendor\n\nfor the Ft. Sill food service contract violated the Randolph-Sheppard Act, implementing\n\nregulations and state rules and regulations.\u201d Id.\n\n       In his second complaint to DOE, Mr. Altstatt had specified that he sought the\n\nfollowing relief: \u201cthat the selection process for the putative winner, Robert Brown, be\n\ndeclared invalid and that Altstatt be awarded the current Contract and profits which he\n\nwould have received during the period of time in which he would have been operating the\n\nContract from ODRS.\u201d App., Vol. 4 at 715. DOE\u2019s notices to the parties incorporated\n\nthis language by reference: \u201cA complete statement of . . . the relief sought is contained in\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthis complaint for arbitration.\u201d App., Vol. 5 at 765, 767. The notices did not advise the\n\nparties of any limitations on the types of relief the Panel could award.\n\n       In January 2016, after a hearing in November at which \u201c[c]ounsel for the parties\n\npresented opening statements and then called witnesses to give sworn testimony,\u201d the\n\nPanel rendered a decision in favor of Mr. Altstatt. App., Vol. 4 at 635, 643. As relevant\n\nto this appeal, the Panel concluded that ODRS\u2019s re-selection of Mr. Brown for the\n\nContract assignment was invalid because (1) \u201c[ODRS\u2019s] utiliz[ation] of the same . . .\n\nCommittee again after it had violated its own rules deprived Altstatt of due process and\n\nwas fundamentally unfair,\u201d (2) \u201cone of the committee members (Pride) was personal\n\nfriends with Brown and was known to socialize with him,\u201d and (3) \u201cBrown was not\n\neligible [for the Contract assignment] by the clear meaning of the words set forth in the\n\n[Announcement]\u201d for having been delinquent in his taxes in the relevant time period. Id.\n\nat 641-42. The Panel ordered that ODRS remove Mr. Brown from the Contract\n\nassignment, appoint Mr. Altstatt in Mr. Brown\u2019s place, and pay damages2 and attorney\n\nfees to Mr. Altstatt.\n\n\n       2\n         The Panel ordered ODRS to pay Mr. Altstatt damages \u201cin an amount equal to\nBrown\u2019s net revenue share during the time that he served as the Interim and Permanent\n[Contract manager] along with interest at the legal rate.\u201d App., Vol. 4 at 643-45. At the\narbitration hearing, Mr. Altstatt had called a damages expert to testify. The Panel had\nrejected the expert\u2019s calculations, which were based on the historical financial statements\nof Mr. Brown\u2019s predecessor. Following the Panel\u2019s decision, Mr. Altstatt filed a motion\nrequesting the Panel to set a specific amount of damages and to rely on the expert\u2019s\ndamages calculations or to order the production of and independently review Mr.\nBrown\u2019s financial statements. App., Vol. 4 at 653-57. The Panel denied this motion,\nstating that it \u201cset the damages in its original order with parameters sufficient to calculate\nthe amount of damages and has no authority to hear additional evidence or modify said\norder.\u201d Id. at 650.\n\n                                              7\n\f                          D. Federal District Court Proceedings\n\n         ODRS sued DOE in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma,\n\nseeking judicial review of the Panel\u2019s decision. Mr. Altstatt intervened as a defendant\n\nand counterclaimant, requesting that the court affirm the arbitration decision. After filing\n\nthe administrative record of the Panel proceedings, DOE obtained the parties\u2019 stipulation\n\nthat it \u201cis a nominal defendant in terms of the rights, claims and remedies sought to be\n\nreviewed [in the case].\u201d Dist. Ct. Doc. 21 at 4. The court accepted the parties\u2019\n\nstipulation and designated DOE a nominal defendant, such that it \u201c[was] not required to\n\nparticipate in any substantive proceedings . . . unless [specifically] directed to do so.\u201d Id.\n\nat 1.3\n\n         Disallowing any discovery, the court ordered ODRS and Mr. Altstatt to submit\n\nbriefs on all of the issues. In its brief, ODRS attacked, as arbitrary or capricious and\n\nunsupported by substantial evidence, the Panel\u2019s following bases for concluding that its\n\npermanent selection of Mr. Brown for the Contract assignment was contrary to the RSA:\n\n(1) the re-selection process was infirm, (2) Mr. Pride and Mr. Brown were friends at the\n\nrelevant time, and (3) Mr. Brown was ineligible for the Contract Assignment because of\n\nhis tax delinquency. ODRS also challenged each type of relief granted by the Panel:\n\n(1) the removal of Mr. Brown from the Contract assignment as violating Mr. Brown\u2019s\n\ndue process, (2) the appointment of Mr. Altstatt to the Contract assignment as exceeding\n\n\n         3\n        Mr. Brown did not seek to intervene in the district court proceedings at any\npoint. After the entry of final judgment, Mr. Brown filed a motion in this court to\nintervene in ODRS\u2019s appeal. We denied this motion as untimely.\n\n                                              8\n\fthe scope of the Panel\u2019s remedial authority under the RSA and alternatively as arbitrary\n\nor capricious, (3) the damages award as barred by sovereign immunity, and (4) the\n\nattorney fee award as exceeding the scope of the Panel\u2019s remedial authority under the\n\nRSA and alternatively as barred by sovereign immunity.\n\n       After receiving briefs from ODRS and Mr. Altstatt on these issues, the district\n\ncourt upheld the Panel\u2019s decision in favor of Mr. Altstatt and all relief granted. The court\n\nrejected on the merits all but one of ODRS\u2019s claims\u2014the due process challenge to the\n\nPanel\u2019s order to remove Mr. Brown from the Contract assignment. The court determined\n\nthat ODRS lacked standing to assert the rights of Mr. Brown, a non-party to the litigation,\n\nthrough this claim. The court later entered final judgment, in which it affirmed the\n\n\u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law set forth in the [Panel\u2019s decision] . . . in favor\n\nof [Mr.] Altstatt.\u201d App., Vol. 8 at 1384. It further ordered ODRS to remove Mr. Brown\n\nas the Contract manager, replace him with Mr. Altstatt, and pay damages and attorney\n\nfees to Mr. Altstatt as provided for in the Panel\u2019s decision.\n\n       ODRS appealed from the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Panel\u2019s decision,\n\nreasserting all of the arguments it presented below. After oral argument, we ordered the\n\nparties, including DOE, to submit supplemental briefs on issues pertaining to sovereign\n\nimmunity and the scope of the Panel\u2019s remedial power under the RSA. DOE attached to\n\nits supplemental brief a document titled \u201cRevised Interim Policies and Procedures for\n\nConvening and Conducting an Arbitration Pursuant to Sections 5(a) and 6 of the\n\nRandolph-Sheppard Act as Amended\u201d (\u201cRSA Arbitration Policies\u201d). This document,\n\nwhich the Commissioner of DOE\u2019s Rehabilitation Services Administration approved in\n\n                                              9\n\f1978, establishes the policies and procedures governing the arbitration of blind vendors\u2019\n\ngrievances against SLAs under the RSA.\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n      We begin with our standard of review. We then turn to ODRS\u2019s various\n\nchallenges to the Panel\u2019s decision, providing additional background as needed.\n\n                                  A. Standard of Review\n\n      \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s decision in an APA case.\u201d Biodiversity\n\nConservation All. v. Jiron, 762 F.3d 1036, 1059 (10th Cir. 2014). Accordingly, we apply\n\nthe standards for reviewing final agency actions set forth in the APA:\n\n             To the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the\n             reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law,\n             interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and\n             determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an\n             agency action. The reviewing court shall\u2014\n\n             ...\n\n             (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and\n                 conclusions found to be\u2014\n\n                   (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n                       otherwise not in accordance with law;\n                   (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or\n                       immunity;\n                   (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\n                       limitations, or short of statutory right;\n                   (D) without observance of procedure required by law; [or]\n                   (E) unsupported by substantial evidence in a case . . .\n                       reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided\n                       by statute . . . .\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (emphases added).\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f                         B. ODRS\u2019s Challenges under the APA\n\n       ODRS raises various APA challenges to (1) the Panel\u2019s conclusion that ODRS\u2019s\n\npermanent selection of Mr. Brown for the Contract assignment violated the RSA, and (2)\n\nspecific types of relief awarded to Mr. Altstatt, whom the Panel determined should have\n\nreceived the Contract assignment instead of Mr. Brown. We affirm the district court\u2019s\n\ndecision as to the Panel\u2019s order to remove Mr. Brown from the Contract assignment and\n\nreplace him with Mr. Altstatt, but we reverse as to the Panel\u2019s award of damages and\n\nattorney fees.\n\n       We first review the Panel\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Brown\u2019s selection violated the\n\nRSA. ODRS attacks as arbitrary or capricious or as unsupported by substantial evidence\n\nthe Panel\u2019s reasons for this conclusion: infirmity in ODRS\u2019s re-selection process, the\n\nfriendship between Mr. Brown and Mr. Pride, and Mr. Brown\u2019s ineligibility. We need\n\nonly consider ODRS\u2019s arguments regarding the Panel\u2019s third reason\u2014Mr. Brown\u2019s\n\nineligibility for the Contract assignment due to tax issues. Based on our review of the\n\nrecord, we conclude that the Panel\u2019s finding of ineligibility was not arbitrary or\n\ncapricious or unsupported by substantial evidence. Because this reason alone supports\n\nthe Panel\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Brown\u2019s selection violated the RSA, we do not consider\n\nODRS\u2019s arguments regarding the Panel\u2019s remaining reasons.\n\n       We then turn to the Panel\u2019s remedies awarded to Mr. Altstatt. ODRS challenges:\n\n(a) Mr. Altstatt\u2019s appointment to the Contract assignment as exceeding the scope of the\n\nPanel\u2019s remedial authority under the RSA and as arbitrary or capricious; (b) the damages\n\naward as violating sovereign immunity; and (c) the attorney fee award as exceeding the\n\n                                             11\n\fscope of the Panel\u2019s remedial authority and as violating sovereign immunity.4 We\n\nconclude that (a) the Panel had statutory authority to order Mr. Altstatt\u2019s appointment to\n\nthe Contract; (b) ODRS is entitled to sovereign immunity from the damages award; and\n\n(c) the Panel exceeded its statutory authority in awarding Mr. Altstatt attorney fees.5\n\n   The Panel\u2019s Conclusion that ODRS Violated the RSA\n\n       Under the APA, the reviewing court must \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency\n\naction,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), that is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n\notherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d id. \u00a7 706(2)(A), or \u201cunsupported by substantial\n\nevidence,\u201d id. \u00a7 706(2)(E). ODRS contends the Panel\u2019s finding that Mr. Brown was\n\nineligible for the Contract assignment due to tax issues \u201cis not supported by substantial\n\nevidence and is arbitrary.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 40. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         ODRS also challenges the Panel\u2019s removal of Mr. Brown as violating Mr.\nBrown\u2019s due process rights. See Aplt. Br. at 28-31. We decline to address this claim,\nwhich the district court dismissed for lack of standing. App., Vol. 8 at 1372 n.28\n(\u201cOrdinarily a litigant may only assert its own constitutional rights and a plaintiff cannot\nsue for the deprivation of another\u2019s civil rights; the Court therefore has disregarded this\nargument.\u201d). On appeal, ODRS fails to address its standing to bring the due process\nclaim, both in its opening brief and in its reply brief, even after Mr. Altstatt argued lack\nof standing in his response brief. Under these circumstances, ODRS has waived any\nargument that it has standing to pursue a due process claim on Mr. Brown\u2019s behalf, and\nwe therefore do not entertain such a claim. See Colorado Outfitters Ass\u2019n v.\nHickenlooper, 823 F.3d 537, 552 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201c[T]he plaintiffs don\u2019t argue on\nappeal that [one of the plaintiffs] had standing. . . . Thus, the plaintiffs have waived that\nargument.\u201d).\n       5\n          We do not address ODRS\u2019s contention that sovereign immunity bars the attorney\nfee award because we conclude the RSA does not authorize attorney fees. We reverse the\ndistrict court\u2019s affirmance of the Panel\u2019s attorney fee award on this basis alone.\n\n                                             12\n\f       We (a) summarize the evidence before the Panel relating to the tax eligibility\n\nrequirement for the Contract assignment and Mr. Brown\u2019s tax issues; (b) provide legal\n\nbackground on the federal contracting regulations ODRS relies on to challenge the\n\nPanel\u2019s finding that Mr. Brown was tax delinquent and therefore ineligible for the\n\nContract assignment; and (c) analyze the Panel\u2019s finding in light of the administrative\n\nrecord and conclude that the finding was neither unsupported by substantial evidence, nor\n\nwas it arbitrary or capricious.\n\n       a. Relevant evidence in the administrative record\n\n       We summarize the evidence relating to (i) the Contract assignment\u2019s tax eligibility\n\nrequirement and (ii) Mr. Brown\u2019s tax issues in the period leading up to ODRS\u2019s selection\n\nprocess.\n\n              i. The tax eligibility requirement\n\n       The Announcement for the Contract assignment enumerated several \u201celigibility\n\ncriteria,\u201d including that applicants must not \u201chave had any delinquency on taxes for the\n\npast 3 years.\u201d App., Vol. 7 at 1139.\n\n       The administrative record contains the affidavit of Michael Jones, who served as\n\nODRS\u2019s Division Administrator from July 2011 to April 2013. App., Vol. 7 at 1124-25.\n\nIn his affidavit, Mr. Jones stated that he \u201cwrote the applicant requirements for the\n\n[Announcement].\u201d Id. at 1124. He stated that \u201c[o]ne of these requirements was that the\n\nsuccessful applicant could not have any tax delinquencies\u201d and that he had \u201cincluded the\n\ntax delinquency provision . . . based on requirements found in the Defense Finance\n\nAcquisition Regulations, or \u2018DFARS\u2019 that govern all federal contracts.\u201d Id. at 1124,\n\n                                             13\n\f1125. He also stated that, \u201cif [this requirement] was not met, [it] would be grounds for\n\nthe federal contracting officer administering [the Contract] to \u2018debar\u2019 or deem the\n\nselected manager disqualified from continuing to work at the facility.\u201d Id. at 1124.\n\n       At the arbitration hearing, ODRS called Mike Hamrick, its Operations Coordinator\n\nfor the RSA Program, to testify. He testified that the tax eligibility requirement is not in\n\nODRS\u2019s rules and regulations but instead \u201ccomes from the DFARS.\u201d App., Vol. 6 at\n\n1049. He also testified that ODRS had not undertaken to check whether the candidates\n\nfor the Contract assignment satisfied the tax eligibility requirement, \u201csince it w[as] the\n\nArmy\u2019s [rather than ODRS\u2019s own] requirement[].\u201d Id. at 1050.\n\n              ii. Mr. Brown\u2019s tax issues\n\n       The administrative record contains notices of two federal tax liens filed against\n\nMr. Brown\u2019s property within the three years preceding the application due date for the\n\nContract assignment, December 21, 2012. App., Vol. 7 at 1141-42. In both notices, the\n\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) stated that \u201ctaxes . . . have been assessed against\n\n[Mr. Brown and his wife]\u201d and that the United States \u201cha[s] made a demand for payment\n\nof this liability, but it remains unpaid.\u201d Id. In the first notice, prepared on February 18,\n\n2011, the IRS assessed an unpaid balance of $15,117.95 from tax years 2008 and 2009.\n\nIn the second notice, prepared on November 1, 2012, the IRS assessed an unpaid balance\n\nof $6,481.96 from tax year 2010. In both notices, the IRS also stated that \u201cthere is a lien\n\nin favor of the United States on all property and rights to property belonging to [Mr.\n\nBrown and his wife] for the amount of these taxes.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       The administrative record also contains Mr. Brown\u2019s sworn affidavit, in which he\n\nstates that he had entered into an installment payment plan for his unpaid taxes with the\n\nIRS before ODRS selected him for the Contract assignment:\n\n               At the time that I received the invitation to apply [for the\n               Contract assignment] I was concluding negotiation of a\n               payment plan with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for\n               certain personal income taxes that had not been properly filed\n               on my behalf in prior years. I did enter into an agreed\n               payment plan before the [ODRS] selection process had\n               concluded. My monthly payments at an agreed amount began\n               in February, 2013. To the extent that the IRS has filed any\n               liens relating to taxes owed by me, those claimed taxes due\n               are covered by the repayment plan and I have been assured\n               that the IRS will not attempt any collection or treat me as a\n               delinquent taxpayer while I am making the agreed payments\n               according to the agreed payment plan.\n\nId. at 1126.\n\n       In his affidavit, Mr. Brown also stated that he had \u201cdiscussed the above matter\n\nwith Division Manager Mike Jones before applying for the selection process\u201d and that\n\nMr. Jones had \u201creferred to particular U.S. Army regulations for contracting (DFARS) as\n\nthe reason for including in the [Announcement] a section stating that the successful\n\napplicant would need to be clear of any tax delinquency.\u201d Id. at 1127. Mr. Brown stated\n\nthat Mr. Jones had \u201cadvised [him] that DFARS itself contained a provision saying that\n\ntaxes covered by an agreed repayment plan do not constitute a delinquency, and that\n\n[ODRS] would not consider [his] tax matter covered by a payment plan to be a\n\ndelinquency.\u201d Id.\n\n       Mr. Jones\u2019s affidavit corroborated Mr. Brown\u2019s affidavit. In his affidavit, Mr.\n\nJones stated: \u201cPrior to submitting his application for the [Contract assignment], Robert\n\n                                            15\n\fBrown advised me that he had learned that he had some unpaid federal taxes but that he\n\nhad previously entered into a payment plan to satisfy his tax obligations and was making\n\nhis payments as agreed.\u201d Id. at 1125. Mr. Jones also stated: \u201cApplying both the DFARS\n\nstandards and common sense, I determined that the payment plan being in place and not\n\nbeing breached meant that Mr. Brown did not have a tax \u2018delinquency\u2019 that would\n\ndisqualify him from the selection process or from performing [the Contract] if selected,\n\nand I advised him of that position.\u201d Id.\n\n       Mr. Brown also testified at the arbitration hearing regarding unpaid taxes and his\n\ninstallment plan with the IRS. He elaborated on the plan\u2019s terms: \u201cI was to pay back a\n\nset amount monthly, and then if there were ever any issues where I might [] be late, then\n\nthey needed me to make sure I contacted them so that I would continue to be considered\n\nin good standing.\u201d App., Vol. 6 at 1031.\n\n       b. Legal background\n\n       The Federal Acquisition Regulations System (\u201cFARS\u201d) is a set of regulations\n\njointly promulgated by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration,\n\nand the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish \u201cuniform policies\n\nand procedures for acquisition by all executive agencies.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.101, 1.103.\n\nUnder the regulations, \u201c[a]cquisition means the acquiring by contract with appropriated\n\nfunds of supplies or services . . . by and for the use of the Federal Government through\n\npurchase or lease . . . .\u201d Id. \u00a7 2.101.\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f      Under FARS, a federal contractor may be debarred \u201cbased upon a preponderance\n\nof the evidence\u201d for, among other things, \u201c[d]elinquent Federal taxes in an amount that\n\nexceeds $3,500.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9.406-2(b)(1)(v).6 FARS provides that:\n\n             (A) Federal taxes are considered delinquent for purposes of\n                 this provision if both of the following criteria apply:\n\n                    (1) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability\n                        is finally determined if it has been assessed. A\n                        liability is not finally determined if there is a\n                        pending administrative or judicial challenge. In\n                        the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the\n                        liability is not finally determined until all judicial\n                        appeal rights have been exhausted.\n\n                    (2) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A\n                        taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to\n                        pay the tax liability when full payment was due and\n                        required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases\n                        where enforced collection action is precluded.\n\n             (B) Examples.\n\n                    ...\n\n                    (2) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with\n                        respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer\n                        has been issued a notice under I.R.C. \u00a7 6320\n                        entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the\n                        IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,\n                        and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS\n                        determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course\n                        of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest\n                        the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer\n                        has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.\n                        This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final\n\n      6\n        \u201cDebarment means action taken . . . to exclude a contractor from Government\ncontracting and Government-approved subcontracting for a reasonable, specified period;\na contractor that is excluded is \u2018debarred.\u2019\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.101.\n\n                                            17\n\f                           tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court\n                           review, this will not be a final tax liability until the\n                           taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\n\n                     (3) The taxpayer has entered into an installment\n                         agreement pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6159. The taxpayer\n                         is making timely payments and is in full\n                         compliance with the agreement terms. The\n                         taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is\n                         not currently required to make full payment.\n\n                     ...\n\nId. \u00a7 9.406-2(b)(1)(v) (emphases added).\n       c. Analysis\n\n       The Panel\u2019s finding that Mr. Brown was ineligible for the Contract assignment\n\nbecause he had a tax delinquency during the relevant time period was neither\n\nunsupported by substantial evidence, nor arbitrary or capricious.7 Because this finding\n\nalone supports the Panel\u2019s conclusion that ODRS violated the RSA in selecting Mr.\n\nBrown, we need not address ODRS\u2019s challenges to the Panel\u2019s other bases for it\n\nconclusion.8\n\n\n\n       7\n        We address both ODRS\u2019s substantial evidence and arbitrary or capricious\nchallenges together because \u201c[t]he arbitrary and capricious standard of review has been\nequated to the substantial evidence test.\u201d AllCare Home Health, Inc. v. Shalala, 278 F.3d\n1087, 1089 (10th Cir. 2001). Our review under both standards is \u201cnarrow and highly\ndeferential to the agency.\u201d Jake\u2019s Fireworks Inc. v. Acosta, 893 F.3d 1248, 1257 (10th\nCir. 2018). Under these standards, we do not overturn an agency\u2019s factual findings if \u201ca\nreasonable mind would consider the evidence adequate to support the conclusion\nreached.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted).\n       8\n         Under the RSA, participating SLAs must \u201c[t]ake effective action . . . to carry out\nfull responsibility for the supervision and management of each vending facility in its\nprogram in accordance with its established rules and regulations, [DOE regulations], and\nthe terms and conditions governing the permit [for each vending facility].\u201d 34 C.F.R.\n                                                18\n\f       The administrative record adequately supports the Panel\u2019s finding that Mr. Brown\n\nhad tax delinquencies in the three-year period before the Announcement\u2019s publication in\n\nDecember 2012 and was therefore ineligible for the Contract assignment. ODRS\u2019s\n\nAnnouncement expressly \u201cdeemed as [an] eligibility criteri[on]\u201d an applicant\u2019s not\n\nhaving \u201chad any delinquency on taxes for the past 3 years.\u201d App., Vol. 7 at 1139\n\n(emphasis added). ODRS contends that the term \u201cdelinquency\u201d as used in the\n\nAnnouncement should be given the same meaning it has under FARS debarment rules.\n\nBut even accepting the FARS definition, the Panel did not err in concluding that Mr.\n\nBrown had a delinquency sometime in the three years before December 2012. In Mr.\n\nBrown\u2019s notices of federal tax lien, the IRS stated that it had \u201cassessed\u201d tax liabilities\n\nagainst Mr. Brown in tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010 and that Mr. Brown failed to\n\ncomply when the IRS had previously \u201cmade a demand for payment.\u201d Id. at 1141, 1142.9\n\n\n\u00a7 395.3(a)(11)(ii). Accordingly, whether the tax eligibility requirement published in the\nAnnouncement was ODRS\u2019s rule or, as ODRS maintains, the Army\u2019s rule, ODRS\u2019s\nfailure to enforce the requirement violated the RSA Program\u2019s terms.\n       9\n         Under FARS, a tax liability is not a delinquency \u201cif there is a pending\nadministrative or judicial challenge.\u201d 48 C.F.R \u00a7 9.406-2(b)(1)(v)(A)(1). Accordingly,\nwhen the IRS files a federal tax lien and the taxpayer requests a hearing to \u201ccontest the\nunderlying tax liability,\u201d the liability is not a delinquency. Id. \u00a7 9.406-2(b)(1)(v)(B)(2).\nAnd \u201c[s]hould the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until\nthe taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\u201d Id. ODRS relies on \u00a7 9.406-\n2(b)(1)(v)(B)(2) for the proposition that \u201cthe mere existence of a Notice of Federal Tax\nLien is not evidence of a tax delinquency.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 40. And it contends that \u201c[s]ince\nthe burden of proof was on Altstatt and his only evidence on Brown\u2019s tax delinquency\nwas the Notice of Federal Tax Liens, the Panel\u2019s conclusion that Brown was delinquent is\nnot supported by substantial evidence and is arbitrary.\u201d Id. We disagree.\n       Taken together, \u00a7\u00a7 9.406-2(b)(1)(v)(A)(1) and 9.406-2(b)(1)(v)(B)(2) mean that\nan assessed tax liability is not a delinquency only to the extent the taxpayer pursues an\nadministrative or judicial challenge. Here, the administrative record does not show that\n                                              19\n\f       Mr. Brown\u2019s installment plan to repay his taxes does not compel a contrary\n\nconclusion. Under FARS, a taxpayer who \u201chas entered into an installment agreement\u201d\n\nand \u201cis making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms\u201d is\n\nnot delinquent. 48 C.F.R \u00a7 9.406-2(b)(1)(v)(B)(3). According to his affidavit and\n\ntestimony, Mr. Brown learned of his unpaid taxes sometime in 2012 and entered into an\n\ninstallment agreement with the IRS after ODRS published the Announcement in\n\nDecember 2012. See App., Vol. 6 at 1028, 1030-31; App., Vol. 7 at 1126. But he had a\n\ntax delinquency as early as February 18, 2011, when the IRS prepared the first notice of\n\nfederal tax lien. App., Vol. 7 at 1141. His later installment plan cannot erase the fact that\n\nhe had a tax delinquency during the three-year period preceding the Announcement\u2019s\n\npublication, contrary to its stated eligibility requirements. See App., Vol. 7 at 1139\n\n(requiring applicants \u201c[n]ot to have had any delinquency on taxes for the past 3 years\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)). The record therefore contains substantial evidence that Mr. Brown\n\nwas ineligible for the Contract assignment.\n\n   The Relief Granted to Mr. Altstatt by the Panel\n\n       Having rejected ODRS\u2019s challenges to the Panel\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Brown\u2019s\n\nselection violated the RSA, we now turn to ODRS\u2019s challenges to the types of relief the\n\nMr. Brown pursued such a challenge. Despite Mr. Brown\u2019s participation in the\narbitration hearing as a witness, he never mentioned such a challenge. Instead, he\ntestified that he did not learn of his tax liabilities until \u201cthe 2012 time frame,\u201d App.,\nVol. 6 at 1028, despite the IRS\u2019s filing notice of tax lien in February 2011 based on\nunpaid taxes from 2008 and 2009, App., Vol. 7 at 1141. He further testified that after he\nlearned of the liabilities, rather than pursue a challenge, he began negotiating an\ninstallment plan with the IRS. App., Vol. 6 at 1030-31. In light of this record, we\nconclude that \u201ca reasonable mind would consider the evidence adequate to support the\n[Panel\u2019s] conclusion.\u201d Jake\u2019s Fireworks Inc., 893 F.3d at 1257 (quotations omitted).\n                                              20\n\fPanel granted to Mr. Altstatt, whom the Panel determined should have received the\n\nContract assignment instead. Providing additional legal background as needed, we\n\naddress (a) the Panel\u2019s order to appoint Mr. Altstatt to the Contract, (b) the Panel\u2019s award\n\nof damages to Mr. Altstatt, and (c) the Panel\u2019s award of attorney fees to Mr. Altstatt.\n\n       a. Order to appoint Mr. Alstatt to the Contract\n\n       Under the APA, the reviewing court must \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency\n\naction,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), that is \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\n\nlimitations,\u201d id. \u00a7 706(2)(C). ODRS contends the Panel exceeded its remedial authority\n\nunder the RSA in ordering Mr. Altstatt\u2019s appointment to the Contract assignment. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       We begin with legal background on arbitration panels\u2019 power to grant prospective,\n\nor injunctive, relief to aggrieved blind vendors under the RSA. We then analyze whether\n\nthe Panel\u2019s order to appoint Mr. Altstatt to the Contract assignment exceeded the scope of\n\nthe Panel\u2019s authority and conclude that it did not.\n\n              i. Legal background\n\n       This court has not previously considered what forms of relief arbitration panels\n\nmay grant aggrieved blind vendors under the RSA. Although this question has received\n\nlimited judicial attention, the approaches to prospective relief in three out-of-circuit cases\n\nhelp inform our analysis: (1) Delaware Department of Health & Social Services v.\n\nUnited States Department of Education, 772 F.2d 1123 (3d Cir. 1985); (2) Georgia\n\nDepartment of Human Resources v. Nash, 915 F.2d 1482 (11th Cir. 1990); and (3)\n\nWisconsin Department of Workforce Development v. United States Department of\n\n                                              21\n\fEducation, 667 F. Supp. 2d 1007 (W.D. Wis. 2009). We summarize the relevant\n\ndiscussion from each case.10\n\n                      1) Delaware Department of Health and Social Services\u2014\n                         interpreting the RSA in light of established arbitration principles\n       In Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, the Third Circuit\n\nconsidered whether the RSA authorizes arbitration panels to grant retrospective relief to\n\naggrieved blind vendors. The district court had vacated an arbitration award of\n\nretrospective damages based on its \u201cconclu[sion] that prospective arbitral relief against\n\nDelaware was clearly within the authority of the arbitrators . . . , but that . . . Congress\n\ncould not have intended that the arbitrators have the authority to award retrospective\n\nrelief.\u201d 772 F.2d at 1136.\n\n       The Third Circuit reversed, holding that \u201cthe district court erred in concluding that\n\nthe arbitrators in a Randolph-Sheppard arbitration were not authorized to award\n\ncompensatory damages.\u201d Id. at 1137. In reaching this outcome, and as relevant to our\n\nconcern about prospective relief, the court considered the legal backdrop against which\n\nCongress had provided for arbitration of blind vendors\u2019 grievances under the RSA. The\n\ncourt considered that, \u201c[w]hen Congress [amended the RSA] in 1974 [to] provide[] that\n\nstates desiring to gain access to blind vendor locations in federal facilities must agree to\n\nsubmit to arbitration their disputes with blind vendors, the term arbitration had a well-\n\nrecognized meaning.\u201d Id. at 1136.\n\n10\n  We describe these decisions, not to opine on their holdings or results, but to detect\napproaches to remedial authority that may help us in deciding whether the injunctive\nrelief awarded in this case was proper.\n\n                                              22\n\f       The court further considered that, in enacting the 1974 amendments, \u201cCongress\n\nwas surely aware that arbitrators proceeding under the authority of the Federal\n\nArbitration Act or under the authority of the Uniform Arbitration Act, as a matter of\n\ncourse awarded retrospective compensatory relief in appropriate cases.\u201d Id. It also\n\nreviewed the legislative history materials and found \u201cno . . . support[] [for] any reading of\n\nthe term arbitration other than the conventional one.\u201d Id. at 1137.\n\n       Although Delaware also \u201ccontend[ed] that even prospective relief was improper,\u201d\n\nthe Third Circuit did not address that question because the arbitration was limited to the\n\nclaims of the blind vendor, who did not seek prospective relief. Id. at 1137 n.9; see id.\n\nat 1132. The court did not speak directly to whether an RSA arbitration panel may grant\n\nprospective relief, but it noted that the RSA \u201clends no support for the distinction drawn\n\nby the district court between prospective and compensatory relief.\u201d Id. at 1136-37.\n\n                     2) Georgia Department of Human Resources\u2014interpreting the RSA\n                        in view of the differences between \u00a7\u00a7 107d-2(b)(1) and 107d-\n                        2(b)(2)\n       In Georgia Department of Human Resources, the Eleventh Circuit considered\n\nwhether the RSA authorizes arbitration panels to award damages to a blind vendor \u201cbased\n\non [the SLA\u2019s] failure to complain when a federal entity closed a vending stand located\n\non property under its control.\u201d 915 F.2d at 1483. The district court had \u201cupheld an\n\naward of compensatory damages to the blind vendor made by an arbitration panel\n\nconvened under the Act\u201d based on its \u201cinterpret[ation] [of] the statute to provide a blind\n\nvendor with [such] an action.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that \u201cthe district court ha[d] misinterpreted\n\nthe statute\u201d and that such a \u201ccause of action is inconsistent both with the Act\u2019s express\n\nlanguage and its remedial structure.\u201d Id. at 1483, 1484-85. Again, as relevant to our\n\nconcern, the court observed that the RSA provides separately for the arbitration of blind\n\nvendors\u2019 grievances against SLAs under \u00a7 107d-1(a) and for the arbitration of SLAs\u2019\n\ngrievances against federal entities under \u00a7 107d-1(b). Id. at 1487. It determined that the\n\nprocedures for the two types of arbitration \u201care similar, but different, and these\n\ndifferences undermine the cause of action at issue.\u201d Id. at 1490.\n\n       Sections 107d-2(b)(1) and 107d-2(b)(2) of the RSA, which respectively establish\n\nprocedures for vendor-versus-SLA and SLA-versus-federal entity arbitrations, mirror\n\neach other in structure\u2014with one notable exception. The last sentence in \u00a7 107d-2(b)(2),\n\nwhich lacks a counterpart in \u00a7 107d-2(b)(1), provides:\n\n              If the [arbitration panel appointed to hear an SLA\u2019s\n              complaint] finds that the acts or practices of [the federal\n              entity] are in violation of [the RSA or any implementing\n              regulation], the head of any such [entity] shall cause such acts\n              or practices to be terminated promptly and shall take such\n              other action as may be necessary to carry out the decision of\n              the panel.\n\n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-2(b)(2).\n\n       Relying on the inclusion of this sentence in \u00a7 107d-2(b)(2) and not in \u00a7 107d-\n\n2(b)(1), the Eleventh Circuit determined that \u201cthe [arbitration] panel\u2019s remedial powers\n\nvary under the two [types of arbitration].\u201d Ga. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 915 F.2d at 1491\n\n(emphasis added). It said that \u201c[s]ection 107d\u20132 provides specific direction to the\n\narbitration panel regarding remedies in [SLA-versus-federal entity] cases but provides no\n\n                                             24\n\finstruction at all regarding remedies in [vendor-versus-SLA] cases.\u201d Id. The court\n\ninterpreted the sentence\u2019s inclusion in \u00a7 107d-2(b)(2) as \u201climit[ing] the panel\u2019s authority\n\nto . . . determine that a violation is occurring and . . . identify[ing] the discrete acts that\n\nare in violation.\u201d Id. at 1492. It thus determined that the RSA \u201cdoes not authorize the\n\narbitration panel [hearing an SLA\u2019s complaint against a federal entity] to order the\n\nfederal entity to take any remedial action\u201d and instead \u201cexpressly places the obligation of\n\nending the violation on the federal entity itself.\u201d Id. And the court interpreted the\n\nsentence\u2019s exclusion in \u00a7 107d-2(b)(1) as imposing, \u201c[i]n contrast to the[] express limits\n\non the arbitration panel\u2019s power in [SLA-versus-federal entity] cases, . . . no such limits\n\non the panel in [vendor-versus-SLA] cases.\u201d Id.\n\n       The court summarized the differences in the panel\u2019s remedial powers in the two\n\ntypes of arbitrations:\n\n               Whatever the exact limits of a [vendor-versus-SLA] panel\u2019s\n               remedial powers, its powers are qualitatively different from\n               those of a [SLA-versus-federal entity] panel. The Act gives\n               [vendor-versus-SLA] panels authority to impose remedies\n               directly on the state licensing agency. The [SLA-versus-\n               federal entity] panel, however, under the Act\u2019s express terms,\n               has no remedial powers whatsoever. It may determine that\n               certain of the federal entity\u2019s acts violate the Act, but the Act\n               leaves responsibility for remedying the violation to the\n               federal entity itself.\n\nId. \u201cAlthough [the court did not need to] decide the scope of an arbitration panel\u2019s\n\nremedial powers [in a vendor-versus-SLC arbitration]\u201d to resolve the case before it, it\n\n\u201cnote[d] in passing that the Third Circuit has held that those panels\u2019 remedial powers are\n\nequivalent to the powers of an arbitration panel under the Federal Arbitration Act or the\n\n\n                                               25\n\fUniform Arbitration Act.\u201d Id.

The court vacated the damages award on the\n\nbasis of sovereign immunity but upheld the injunctive relief. In doing so, it reasoned that\n\n\u201cthe arbitration panel must have the authority to grant some relief to blind licensees in\n\norder to give meaning to the arbitration provisions.\u201d 667 F. Supp. 2d at 1015; see also\n\nNew Hampshire v. Ramsey, 366 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe effect of [an] argument\n\n[that neither retrospective damages nor prospective equitable relief is available to blind\n\nvendors] would be to render [the RSA\u2019s grievance] procedures meaningless.\u201d).\n\n              ii. Analysis\n\n       The Panel acted within its remedial power under the RSA in ordering ODRS to\n\nappoint Mr. Altstatt as the Contract manager.11 Confronted with silence as to the\n\nremedies available to aggrieved blind vendors in the RSA\u2019s text, and implementing\n\n\n       11\n           In its supplemental brief, DOE said \u201cthe RSA authorizes arbitration panels to\nissue all forms of prospective equitable relief.\u201d Aplee. DOE Suppl. Br. at 6. We need\nnot decide whether DOE\u2019s interpretation of the statute is entitled to deference because, as\nwe explain below, we agree with DOE even under de novo review. In any event, DOE\nhas not claimed any entitlement to deference. See Hydro Res., Inc. v. U.S. EPA, 608 F.3d\n1131, 1146 (10th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (\u201c[W]hen the agency doesn\u2019t ask for deference to\nits statutory interpretation, we need not resolve the issues regarding deference which\nwould be lurking in other circumstances.\u201d (alterations and quotations omitted)).\n\n                                             26\n\fregulations, we find instructive the interpretive approaches other courts have applied to\n\nthe statute.12 And ODRS has not offered\u2014nor have we identified\u2014a competing\n\napproach to interpreting the RSA\u2019s remedial provisions.\n\n       Each of the three approaches to interpreting the RSA in the cases discussed above\n\nlends support to the conclusion that the RSA broadly authorizes arbitration panels to\n\nfashion prospective remedies for aggrieved blind vendors.13 The first approach\u2014\n\ninterpreting the RSA in light of established commercial arbitration principles at the time\n\nCongress enacted the arbitration scheme in 1974\u2014provides support because, under the\n\nAmerican Arbitration Association rules, an arbitrator could \u201cgrant any remedy or relief\n\nwhich he deems just and equitable.\u201d Martin Domke, The Law and Practice of\n\n       12\n          The sparse legislative history on this issue points to the result reached here. The\npurpose of the RSA\u2019s vendor-versus-SLA arbitration procedures is to provide aggrieved\nvendors with an effective means to resolve their grievances against SLAs. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep. No. 98-937, at 20 (1974) (\u201cIt is the expectation of the Committee [on Labor and\nPublic Welfare] that the arbitration and review procedures . . . will provide the means by\nwhich aggrieved vendors . . . may obtain a final and satisfactory resolution of disputes.\u201d\n(emphasis added)). One of the \u201cconditions [that] prompted the inclusion of these\n[arbitration procedures] . . . [was that] blind vendors ha[d] considered previously\navailable legal procedures to be inadequate.\u201d 121 Cong. Rec. 16,227 (1975) (speech on\nRSA Amendments of 1974 inserted into the record by Rep. John Brademas).\n       13\n           We see no reason why such authority should not extend to the specific form of\nrelief at issue here\u2014the order to appoint Mr. Altstatt to the Contract assignment. ODRS\ncontends that, under the RSA, \u201cthe Arbitration Panel had no authority to preempt [its]\nrules concerning how to select managers for a particular facility\u201d and that \u201c[i]ts only\nauthority was to review and judge the selection process that had been conducted.\u201d Aplt.\nBr. at 34. We agree that the RSA delegates authority to SLAs to promulgate rules\ngoverning their operation of the RSA Program, see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107b(5), including the\nselection of blind vendors for particular vending assignments. But the RSA nowhere\nprohibits an arbitration panel from remedying violations of such rules by ordering the\noffending SLA to appoint the aggrieved blind vendor to the disputed assignment should it\nfind that, but for the violation, the vendor would have received the assignment.\n\n                                             27\n\fCommercial Arbitration, \u00a7 30:01 (1968) (quotations omitted). The second approach\u2014\n\ninterpreting the RSA by comparing its provisions pertaining to the two types of\n\narbitration proceedings\u2014offers support because, although Congress included language\n\nlimiting the arbitration panel\u2019s remedial power in SLA-versus-federal entity arbitrations,\n\n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-2(b)(2), no such language appears for vendor-versus-SLA arbitrations,\n\nsee id. \u00a7 107d-2(a). The third approach\u2014interpreting the RSA to effectuate its\n\narbitration scheme\u2014supplies support because, if arbitration panels lacked authority to\n\nfashion injunctive relief, blind vendors would lack a complete remedy for their\n\ngrievances arising from SLAs\u2019 operation of the RSA Program.14\n\n       Drawing on these various approaches to interpreting the RSA\u2019s remedial\n\nprovisions, we conclude that the Panel acted within its remedial power in ordering ODRS\n\nto appoint Mr. Altstatt as the Contract manager.15\n\n\n\n       14\n         Blind vendors ordinarily may not obtain compensatory relief for their grievances\nbecause, as we explain below, SLAs enjoy sovereign immunity from damages awarded to\na blind vendor by an RSA arbitration panel.\n       15\n          ODRS primarily challenges the order to appoint Mr. Altstatt as exceeding the\nscope of the Panel\u2019s statutory authority. But ODRS also appears to bring a separate,\nalbeit cursory, challenge to the order as arbitrary and capricious.\n        As discussed above, the Panel properly found that Mr. Brown was ineligible for\nthe Contract assignment because of his tax delinquency. Mr. Altstatt received the next\nhighest total score of all the candidates and thus presumably should have received the\nContract assignment. App., Vol. 7 at 1231 (Mr. Altstatt received a total score of 300.75,\nwhereas the remaining two candidates received 239.25 and 266.75). ODRS appears to\ncontend, however, that the Panel\u2019s consideration of the candidates\u2019 total scores\u2014\ncomprised of the scores from the original selection process supplemented with the scores\nfor the previously omitted factor, as later calculated by ODRS during the re-selection\nprocess\u2014was arbitrary and capricious given the Panel\u2019s determination that the original\nselection process was flawed. Aplt. Br. at 33. We disagree.\n                                            28\n\f       b. Award of damages to Mr. Altstatt\n\n       Under the APA, the reviewing court must \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency\n\naction,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), that is \u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or\n\nimmunity,\u201d id. \u00a7 706(2)(B). ODRS contends the Panel\u2019s damages award violates its\n\nsovereign immunity. We agree and hold the award should be vacated.\n\n       We begin with legal background on sovereign immunity\u2019s application to agency\n\nadjudications and standards governing waiver of sovereign immunity as to money\n\ndamages. We then proceed to analyze whether sovereign immunity bars the Panel\u2019s\n\ndamages award. Guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Federal Maritime\n\nCommission v. South Carolina State Ports Authority, 535 U.S. 743 (2002), and Sossamon\n\nv. Texas, 563 U.S. 277 (2011), we conclude that it does.\n\n              i. Legal background\n\n       \u201cSovereign immunity is the privilege of the sovereign not to be sued without its\n\nconsent.\u201d Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 253 (2011). A\n\nstate\u2019s sovereign immunity extends to its agencies and departments. Pennhurst State Sch.\n\n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984) (\u201cIt is clear, of course, that in the\n\n\n\n       Apart from Mr. Brown\u2019s ineligibility, the Panel identified two other flaws in the\noriginal selection process: (1) the omission of a required scoring factor, and (2) Mr.\nPride\u2019s friendship with Mr. Brown. But neither flaw rendered the Panel\u2019s consideration\nof the original scores arbitrary or capricious because Mr. Altstatt had the next highest\nscore with or without the scores for the previously omitted factor and with or without the\nscores given by Mr. Pride. See App., Vol. 7 at 1231 (subtracting the previously omitted\n\u201cAnnual Evaluation Score[s]\u201d from the total scores, Mr. Altstatt received 290.75,\nwhereas the remaining two candidates received 226.25 and 251.75; subtracting Mr.\nPride\u2019s scores from the total scores, Mr. Altstatt received 246.75, whereas the remaining\ntwo candidates received 183.25 and 206.75).\n                                             29\n\fabsence of consent a suit in which the State or one of its agencies or departments is\n\nnamed as the defendant is proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment, which constitutionalizes the doctrine of sovereign\n\nimmunity, provides that \u201c[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed\n\nto extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United\n\nStates by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d U.S.\n\nConst. amend.

Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 754.\n\n       We discuss (1) sovereign immunity\u2019s application to agency adjudications and\n\n(2) the standards governing waiver of sovereign immunity as to money damages.\n\n                     1) Sovereign immunity\u2019s application to agency adjudications:\n                        Federal Maritime Commission\n       In Federal Maritime Commission, the Supreme Court addressed for the first time\n\nwhether a state\u2019s sovereign immunity extends to federal agency adjudications of private\n\ncomplaints against state agencies. In this instance, the Federal Maritime Commission\n\n(the \u201cFMC\u201d) adjudicated a complaint filed by a private company against the South\n\nCarolina State Ports Authority, which had denied the company permission to berth a\n\ncruise ship at the state\u2019s port facilities. Id. at 747. The Court \u201ch[eld] that state sovereign\n\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\fimmunity bars the FMC from adjudicating complaints filed by a private party against a\n\nnonconsenting State.\u201d Id. at 760.16\n\n       In its analysis, the Court examined \u201cwhether [FMC adjudications] are the type of\n\nproceedings from which the Framers would have thought the States possessed immunity\n\nwhen they agreed to enter the Union.\u201d Id. at 756. To answer this question, the Court first\n\nconsidered general similarities between an agency adjudication before an Administrative\n\nLaw Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and civil litigation before an Article III judge. It noted the\n\n\u201csimilarities between the role of an ALJ and that of a trial judge\u201d17 and \u201cthe numerous\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          The Court clarified that \u201c[s]overeign immunity does not merely constitute a\ndefense to monetary liability or even to all types of liability\u201d but rather \u201cprovides an\nimmunity from suit.\u201d Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 766. It thus suggested that\nsovereign immunity bars the FMC from adjudicating private complaints against state\nentities \u201cregardless of whether [the adjudication] is for monetary damages or some other\ntype of relief\u201d and, indeed, even \u201cif Congress had . . . precluded [the FMC] from\nawarding [private parties] any relief.\u201d Id. at 765, 766.\n       17\n            The Court said:\n\n                \u201cThere can be little doubt that the role of the modern federal\n                hearing examiner or administrative law judge . . . is\n                \u2018functionally comparable\u2019 to that of a judge. His powers are\n                often, if not generally, comparable to those of a trial judge:\n                He may issue subpoenas, rule on proffers of evidence,\n                regulate the course of the hearing, and make or recommend\n                decisions. More importantly, the process of agency\n                adjudication is currently structured so as to assure that the\n                hearing examiner exercises his independent judgment on the\n                evidence before him, free from pressures by the parties or\n                other officials within the agency.\u201d\n\nFed.

The Court then considered specific similarities between FMC and Article III\n\nproceedings, including: (1) \u201cthe FMC\u2019s Rules governing pleadings are quite similar to\n\nthose found in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\u201d id. at 757; (2) \u201cdiscovery in FMC\n\nadjudications largely mirrors discovery in federal civil litigation,\u201d id. at 758-59;\n\n(3) \u201csimilar to that of an Article III judge,\u201d the ALJ\u2019s role in an FMC adjudication\n\nincludes arranging, giving notice, and managing the conduct of a hearing, granting\n\nappropriate relief, and issuing a ruling that ordinarily becomes the agency\u2019s final\n\ndecision, id. at 759; and (4) the FMC\u2019s own rules provide for application of the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence in many situations, id. at 759\n\n& n.10.\n\n       In light of the foregoing, the Court concluded that \u201cthe similarities between FMC\n\nproceedings and civil litigation are overwhelming.\u201d Id. at 759. It also clarified that\n\n       18\n            The Court said:\n\n                \u201c[F]ederal administrative law requires that agency\n                adjudication contain many of the same safeguards as are\n                available in the judicial process.

Mar. Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 756-57 (quoting Butz, 438 U.S. at 513 (alteration in Fed.\nMar.

Id. It said that \u201c[t]he affront to a State\u2019s dignity does not\n\nlessen when an adjudication takes place in an administrative tribunal as opposed to an\n\nArticle III court.\u201d Id. It further suggested that \u201callowing a private party to haul a State in\n\nfront of such an administrative tribunal constitutes a greater insult . . . than requiring a\n\nState to appear in an Article III court presided over by a judge with life tenure nominated\n\nby the President . . . and confirmed by the . . .

The \u201ctest for determining whether a State has waived its\n\nimmunity . . . is a stringent one.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). \u201cA State\u2019s consent to suit\n\nmust be unequivocally expressed.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). \u201cA state can express such\n\nunequivocal intent by statute, constitutional provision, or through its actions, specifically,\n\nits participation in a particular federal program.\u201d Arbogast v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 789\n\nF.3d 1174, 1182 (10th Cir. 2015) (emphasis added) (quotations omitted). When the\n\nstatute enacting a federal program unequivocally expresses Congress\u2019s intent to condition\n\nstates\u2019 participation on their consenting to suit, their participation then results in a waiver\n\nof sovereign immunity. See id. at 1182-83.\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f       In Sossamon, the Supreme Court addressed the standards governing states\u2019 waiver\n\nof sovereign immunity as to money damages. Sossamon presented the question of\n\n\u201cwhether the States, by accepting federal funds, consent to waive their sovereign\n\nimmunity to suits for money damages under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\n\nPersons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA).\u201d Id. at 280. To answer this question, the Court\n\nexamined RLUIPA, which \u201cincludes an express private cause of action . . . : \u2018A person\n\nmay assert a violation . . . in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a\n\ngovernment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 282 (emphasis added) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-2(a)).\n\n       Based on this language, the Court held that states do not waive sovereign\n\nimmunity by accepting federal funds under RLUIPA. Id. at 280, 285-88. It clarified that\n\nthe \u201cwaiver of sovereign immunity to other types of relief does not waive immunity to\n\ndamages.\u201d Id. at 285. With this principle in mind, it concluded that \u201cRLUIPA\u2019s\n\nauthorization of \u2018appropriate relief against a government,\u2019 \u00a7 2000cc\u20132(a), is not the\n\nunequivocal expression of state consent that our precedents require [to effectuate a\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity].\u201d Id. It reasoned that the term \u201c\u2018[a]ppropriate relief\u2019 is\n\nopen-ended and ambiguous about what types of relief it includes\u201d and that \u201cthe word\n\n\u2018appropriate\u2019 is inherently context-dependent.\u201d Id. at 286. The Court said that \u201c[t]he\n\ncontext here\u2014where the defendant is a sovereign\u2014suggests, if anything, that monetary\n\ndamages are not suitable or proper.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). And it further clarified\n\nthat, \u201cwhere a statute is susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, including one\n\npreserving immunity, we will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign\n\nimmunity.\u201d Id. at 287.\n\n                                             34\n\f              ii. Analysis\n\n       ODRS\u2019s assertion of sovereign immunity as to the Panel\u2019s damages award\n\npresents two questions of first impression before this court: (i) whether sovereign\n\nimmunity extends to RSA arbitrations of vendor complaints, and, if so, (ii) whether\n\nODRS\u2019s participation in the RSA Program effectuates a waiver of sovereign immunity as\n\nto damages. Guided by Federal Maritime Commission and Sossamon, we conclude that\n\nsovereign immunity bars the Panel\u2019s damages award because (i) sovereign immunity\n\nextends to RSA arbitration proceedings, and (ii) ODRS\u2019s participation in the RSA\n\nProgram does waive not its sovereign immunity from damages awards.19\n\n                     1) Sovereign immunity extends to RSA arbitration proceedings\n       We first address whether sovereign immunity extends to arbitrations of vendor\n\ncomplaints against SLAs under the RSA. Our analysis proceeds in two parts. First, we\n\nexamine the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for extending sovereign immunity to FMC\n\nadjudications and conclude that it supports doing so in the RSA context as well. Second,\n\nwe discuss some notable differences between RSA arbitrations and FMC adjudications\n\nand conclude that they do not materially distinguish the two types of proceedings for\n\npurposes of state sovereign immunity.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n         ODRS has not asserted sovereign immunity from RSA arbitration proceedings\ngenerally or from any other type of relief, apart from money damages and attorney fees.\nAs we explain below, the RSA does not authorize attorney fees in any event. We\ntherefore do not decide whether ODRS\u2019s participation in the RSA Program, although not\na waiver of sovereign immunity as to damages, nevertheless waives sovereign immunity\nfrom RSA arbitration proceedings generally or from other forms of relief.\n\n                                            35\n\f                             a) Federal Maritime Commission\u2019s rationale extends to the\n                                RSA context\n       The Supreme Court based its holding in Federal Maritime Commission\u2014that\n\nsovereign immunity applies in the context of FMC adjudications\u2014on the need \u201cto accord\n\nStates the dignity that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities\u201d and on \u201cthe\n\nstrong similarities between FMC proceedings and civil litigation.\u201d 535 U.S. at 760. Both\n\nbases support extending Federal Maritime Commission\u2019s holding to the RSA context.\n\n                                     i) Need to accord dignity\n       As with FMC adjudications, RSA arbitrations of private complaints affront the\n\nstates\u2019 dignity as sovereign entities. In Federal Maritime Commission, the Supreme\n\nCourt explained: \u201c[I]f the Framers thought it an impermissible affront to a State\u2019s dignity\n\nto be required to answer the complaints of private parties in federal courts, we cannot\n\nimagine that they would have found it acceptable to compel a State to do exactly the\n\nsame thing before the administrative tribunal of an agency, such as the FMC.\u201d Id. The\n\nRSA\u2019s mandatory arbitration scheme likewise affronts states\u2019 dignity because it\n\neffectively \u201ccompel[s] a State to [answer private complaints] before the administrative\n\ntribunal of an agency.\u201d Id. Under the RSA, SLAs such as ODRS must submit to final\n\nand binding arbitration of blind vendors\u2019 grievances against them by panels convened by\n\nDOE. See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-1(a).\n\n       Furthermore, the Supreme Court suggested in Federal Maritime Commission that\n\n\u201c[o]ne, in fact, could argue that allowing a private party to haul a State in front of . . . an\n\nadministrative tribunal constitutes a greater insult to a State\u2019s dignity than requiring a\n\nState to appear in an Article III court presided over by a judge with life tenure nominated\n                                               36\n\fby the President . . . and confirmed by the . . . Senate.\u201d 535 U.S. at 760 n.11. Such an\n\nargument appears to have equal, if not greater, force in an RSA arbitration before an\n\nad hoc panel.20\n\n                                    ii) Similarities to Article III proceedings\n       As with FMC adjudications, RSA arbitrations share in common with Article III\n\njudicial proceedings many of the features noted by the Supreme Court as supporting the\n\n\n       20\n          Four justices and several commentators have criticized the Court\u2019s dignity\nrationale in Federal Maritime Commission as confusing or unworkable in application.\nSee Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 772 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe reasons why the\nmajority in [Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793)] concluded that the\n\u2018dignity\u2019 interests underlying the sovereign immunity of English Monarchs had not been\ninherited by the original 13 States remain valid today.

Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 764. DOE lacks broad discretion to dismiss vendor\n\ncomplaints based on policy or other considerations unrelated to the merits. \u201cAs a result,\n\nthe United States plainly does not exercise political responsibility for such complaints,\n\nbut instead has impermissibly effected a broad delegation to private persons to sue\n\nnonconsenting States.\u201d Id. at 764 (alterations and quotations omitted).\n\n       (3) Default Judgments\u2014DOE\u2019s inability to enter default judgments against\n\nSLAs is not at odds with our conclusion that sovereign immunity applies in the RSA\n\ncontext. Notwithstanding this feature of RSA arbitrations, \u201c[an SLA] seeking to contest\n\nthe merits of a complaint filed against it by a [blind vendor] must defend itself in front of\n\nthe [arbitration panel] or substantially compromise its ability to defend itself at all.\u201d Fed.\n\nMar. Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 762. An SLA may decline to file an answer to a blind\n\nvendor\u2019s complaint without incurring a default judgment against it, and yet it would still\n\nbe hard-pressed to decline to participate in the arbitration proceeding in its entirety.23\n\n       Once an arbitration panel has rendered a decision, that decision is \u201cfinal and\n\nbinding on the parties.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-1(a). Although the SLA may seek judicial\n\n\n       23\n         As noted above, the applicable policies and procedures appear to contemplate\nthat an RSA arbitration of a blind vendor\u2019s complaint would proceed whether or not the\nSLA files an answer.

The Supreme Court has previously\n\nestablished \u201ca general rule that courts should not topple over administrative decisions\n\nunless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at\n\nthe time appropriate under its practice.\u201d United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,\n\n344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952). In Federal Maritime Commission, the Court, citing this general\n\nrule, concluded that FMC adjudications are coercive in part because, \u201cif a party fails to\n\nappear before the FMC, it may not then argue the merits of its position in an appeal of the\n\n[FMC\u2019s] determination.\u201d 535 U.S. at 762.\n\n       To the extent the general rule against courts\u2019 considering objections not made in\n\nthe agency proceeding also applies here, failure to appear before the RSA arbitration\n\npanel would severely constrain an SLA\u2019s ability to appeal the merits. And even if the\n\ncourt were to consider the merits, the APA\u2019s judicial review standards would, as a\n\npractical matter, limit the scope of the appeal. See Council Tree Inv\u2019rs, Inc. v. FCC,\n\n739 F.3d 544, 555 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201cAlthough we review matters of law de novo, . . . the\n\nstandard of review is [otherwise] very deferential to the agency.[] A presumption of\n\nvalidity attaches to the agency action and the burden of proof rests with the parties who\n\nchallenge such action.\u201d (citations and quotations omitted)).24\n\n\n       24\n         One other related distinction between FMC and RSA proceedings bears noting\nhere. Unlike the FMC, which \u201cmay impose monetary penalties for each day of\nnoncompliance\u201d with an FMC order, Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 763, the RSA does\nnot authorize DOE to impose sanctions on SLAs that refuse to comply with an arbitration\npanel\u2019s order. We nevertheless conclude that the RSA\u2019s mandatory arbitration scheme as\na whole, like the FMC adjudication scheme, \u201cmakes it quite clear that, absent sovereign\n                                             45\n\f       (4) Formality of Procedures and Rules\u2014The relative informality of RSA\n\narbitrations\u2019 procedures and rules does not undermine Federal Maritime Commission\u2019s\n\napplication to the RSA context. In that case, the Supreme Court said that its \u201creview of\n\nthe FMC\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure confirms that FMC administrative\n\nproceedings bear a remarkably strong resemblance to civil litigation in federal courts.\u201d\n\nFed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. at 757 (emphasis added). Although the rules and\n\nprocedures governing RSA arbitrations are less formal than in FMC adjudications, in\n\nlight of their general similarities and the other considerations discussed above, we\n\nconclude that RSA and Article III proceedings are sufficiently similar to warrant\n\nextending sovereign immunity to the former context.\n\n                                          ****\n       In sum, as in Federal Maritime Commission, the \u201cinterest in protecting States\u2019\n\ndignity and the strong similarities between [RSA] proceedings and civil litigation\u201d\n\ncompel us to conclude that state sovereign immunity bars RSA arbitration panels from\n\nadjudicating complaints filed by a private party against a nonconsenting State. 535 U.S.\n\nat 760.

Compare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-\n\n2(a) with 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107d-1(a), 107d-2(a)-(b)(1). In Sossamon, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that states, by accepting federal funding under RLUIPA, do not waive sovereign\n\nimmunity as to damages because the term \u201cappropriate relief\u201d is too \u201copen-ended and\n\nambiguous about what types of relief it includes.\u201d 563 U.S. at 286. Here, the RSA does\n\nnot even use the words \u201cappropriate relief.\u201d It is silent as to what remedies aggrieved\n\nvendors may obtain against SLAs and is therefore just as \u201copen-ended and ambiguous\u201d as\n\nRLUIPA, if not more.\n\n\n       25\n          This case presents no opportunity to address the extent to which we may look\nbeyond the relevant statute to determine whether a state has waived sovereign immunity\nby participating in a federal program. Here, neither the RSA\u2019s implementing regulations\nnor the RSA Arbitration Policies contain any mention of money damages, and the parties\nhave not provided us with any other material that sheds light on the terms of ODRS\u2019s\nparticipation in the RSA Program.\n\n                                            47\n\f       Under these circumstances, ODRS has not waived its sovereign immunity to a\n\ndamages award from an RSA arbitration panel. But see Del. Dep\u2019t of Health & Soc.\n\nServs., 772 F.2d at 1138 (pre-Sossamon decision holding that a state waives sovereign\n\nimmunity when, \u201cafter full notice of the Act\u2019s requirements, one of which [is] an\n\nagreement to arbitration, it voluntarily ma[kes] application with [DOE] to participate in\n\nthe Randolph-Sheppard program\u201d and that such a waiver extends to damages).\n\n       c. Award of attorney fees to Mr. Altstatt\n\n       Under the APA, the reviewing court must \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency\n\naction,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), that is \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\n\nlimitations,\u201d id. \u00a7 706(2)(C). ODRS contends the Panel exceeded its remedial authority\n\nunder the RSA in awarding attorney fees to Mr. Altstatt. We agree and hold the award\n\nshould be vacated.\n\n       We begin with legal background on the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d regarding the recovery\n\nof attorney fees in civil litigation and its application to administrative proceedings. We\n\nthen proceed to analyze whether the American Rule bars the Panel\u2019s attorney fee award\n\nand conclude that it does.\n\n              i. Legal background\n\n       \u201cOur basic point of reference when considering the award of attorney\u2019s fees is the\n\nbedrock principle known as the American Rule: Each litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s\n\nfees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.\u201d Baker Botts L.L.P. v.\n\nASARCO LLC, 135 S.

Ct. at 2164\n\n(alterations, citations, and quotations omitted). Courts therefore \u201cwill not deviate from\n\nthe American Rule absent explicit statutory authority.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted).\n\n       \u201c[The Supreme Court] ha[s] recognized departures from the American Rule only\n\nin \u2018specific and explicit provisions for the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees under selected\n\nstatutes.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U.S. at 260). \u201cAlthough these [departures]\n\ntake various forms, they tend to authorize the award of \u2018a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee,\u2019\n\n\u2018fees,\u2019 or \u2018litigation costs,\u2019 and usually refer to a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 in the context of an\n\nadversarial \u2018action.\u2019\u201d Id. (citations and quotations omitted).\n\n       Although this court has not addressed the American Rule\u2019s application to\n\nadministrative proceedings, the D.C. Circuit has held that it applies equally in that\n\ncontext. See Unbelievable, Inc. v. NLRB, 118 F.3d 795, 806 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (\u201cThe\n\nAmerican Rule is deeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy. Therefore, we\n\nmay not lightly allow an administrative agency, any more than a court, to depart from the\n\nRule . . . .\u201d (citation and quotations omitted)).\n\n              ii. Analysis\n\n       The Panel exceeded its remedial authority under the RSA in awarding attorney\n\nfees to Mr. Altstatt. We agree with the D.C. Circuit that the American Rule applies in\n\nadministrative proceedings, and we see no reason to depart from it here. The RSA\u2019s text\n\nmakes no mention of attorney fees, litigation costs, prevailing parties, or other related\n\n                                               49\n\fterms. Indeed, the statute is wholly silent as to what relief an arbitration panel may grant\n\nan aggrieved blind vendor, and it provides only that \u201cthe decision of such panel shall be\n\nfinal and binding on the parties\u201d and \u201csubject to appeal and review as a final agency\n\naction.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107d-1(a), 107d-2(a).26 The RSA is thus insufficiently explicit to\n\nauthorize arbitration panels to award attorney fees to aggrieved blind vendors who prevail\n\nin arbitration against their SLA.\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The Panel complied with the APA when it determined that the ODRS violated the\n\nRSA by awarding the Contract to Mr. Brown despite his tax delinquency. It acted within\n\nits authority under the RSA and complied with the APA when it determined that Mr.\n\nAltstatt should have received the Contract assignment and ordered that Mr. Altstatt\n\nreplace Mr. Brown as the Contract vendor.\n\n       The Panel violated state sovereign immunity when it awarded damages to Mr.\n\nAltstatt and against ODRS, and it exceeded the scope of its remedial authority when it\n\nawarded attorney fees to Mr. Altstatt and against ODRS.\n\n       We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Panel\u2019s\n\ndetermination that the ODRS violated the RSA by awarding the Contract to Mr. Brown\n\nand its order to replace Mr. Brown with Mr. Altstatt as the Contract vendor. We reverse\n\n\n\n\n       26\n         DOE\u2019s implementing regulations and the RSA Arbitration Policies likewise do\nnot enumerate what relief may be granted, and the parties have not provided us with any\nother materials relevant to the American Rule\u2019s application.\n\n                                             50\n\fthe district court\u2019s judgment as to the Panel\u2019s award of damages and attorney fees and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\f",
    "re professional to establish, monitor and adjust a treatment plan (diet, exercise, and medication). More specifically, microprocessor-based blood glucose monitoring systems are being marketed which sense the glucose level of a blood sample that is applied to a reagent-impregnated region of a test strip that is inserted in the glucose monitor. When the monitoring sequence is complete, the blood glucose level is displayed by, for example, a liquid crystal display (LCD) unit.\nTypically, currently available self-care blood glucose monitoring units include a calendar/clock circuit and a memory circuit that allows a number of blood glucose test results to be stored along with the date and time at which the monitoring occurred. The stored test results (blood glucose level and associated time and date) can be sequentially recalled for review by the blood glucose monitor user or a health professional by sequentially actuating a push button or other control provided on the monitor. In some commercially available devices, the average of the blood glucose results that are stored in the monitor (or the average of the results for a predetermined period of time, e.g., fourteen days) also is displayed during the recall sequence. Further, some self-care blood glucose monitors allow the user to tag the test result with an \u201cevent code\u201d that can be used to organize the test results into categories. For example, a user might use a specific event code to identify test results obtained at particular times of the day, a different event code to identify a blood glucose reading obtained after a period of exercise, two additional event codes to identify blood glucose readings taken during hypoglycemia symptoms and hyperglycemia symptoms, etc. When event codes are provided and used, the event code typically is displayed with each recalled blood glucose test result.\nMicroprocessor-based blood glucose monitoring systems have advantages other than the capability of obtaining reliable blood glucose test results and storing a number of the results for later recall and review. By using low power microprocessor and memory circuits and powering the units with small, high capacity batteries (e.g., a single alkaline battery), extremely compact and light designs have been achieved that allow taking the blood glucose monitoring system to work, school, or anywhere else the user might go with people encountered by the user not becoming aware of the monitoring system. In addition, most microprocessor-based self-care blood glucose monitoring systems have a memory capacity that allows the system to be programmed by the manufacturer so that the monitor displays a sequence of instructions during any necessary calibration or system tests and during the blood glucose test sequence itself. In addition, the system monitors various system conditions during a blood glucose test (e.g., whether a test strip is properly inserted in the monitor and whether a sufficient amount of blood has been applied to the reagent impregnated portion of the strip) and if an error is detected generates an appropriate display (e.g., \u201cretest\u201d). A data port may be provided that allows test results stored in the memory of the microprocessor-based blood glucose monitoring system to be transferred to a data port (e.g., RS-232 connection) of a personal computer 48 or other such device for subsequent analysis.\nMicroprocessor-based blood glucose monitoring systems are a significant advance over previously available self-care systems such as those requiring a diabetic to apply a blood sample to reagent activated portions of a test strip; wipe the blood sample from the test strip after a predetermined period of time; and, after a second predetermined period of time, determine blood glucose level by comparing the color of the reagent activated regions of the test strip with a color chart supplied by the test strip manufacturer. Despite what has been achieved, numerous drawbacks and disadvantages still exist. For example, establishing and maintaining diabetic healthcare often requires the diabetic to record additional data pertaining to medication, food intake, and exercise. However, the event codes of currently available microprocessor blood glucose monitoring systems provide only limited capability for tagging and tracking blood glucose test results according to food intake and other relevant factors. For example, the event codes of currently available monitoring systems only allow the user to classify stored blood glucose readings in a manner that indicates blood glucose tests taken immediately after a heavy, light or normal meal. This method of recording information not only requires subjective judgment by the system user, but will not suffice in a situation in which successfully controlling the user's diabetes requires the recording and tracking of relatively accurate information relating to food intake, exercise, or medication (e.g., insulin dosage). An otherwise significant advantage of currently available blood glucose monitoring systems is lost when blood glucose test results must be recorded and tracked with quantitative information relating to medication, food intake, or exercise. Specifically, the system user must record the required information along with a time and date tagged blood glucose test result by, for example, writing the information in a log book.\nThe use of event codes to establish subcategories of blood glucose test results has an additional disadvantage or drawback. In particular, although alphanumeric display devices are typically used in currently available microprocessor-based blood glucose monitoring systems, the display units are limited to a single line of information having on the order of six characters. Moreover, since the systems include no provision for the user to enter alphanumeric information, any event codes that are used must be indicated on the display in a generic manner, e.g., displayed as \u201cEVENT\u201dEVENT etc. This limitation makes the system more difficult to use because the diabetic must either memorize his or her assignment of event codes or maintain a list that defines the event codes. The limited amount of data that can be displayed at any one time presents additional drawbacks and disadvantages. First, instructions and diagnostics that are displayed to the user when calibrating the system and using the system to obtain a blood glucose reading must be displayed a line at a time and in many cases, the information must be displayed in a cryptic manner.\nThe above-discussed display limitations and other aspects of currently available blood glucose monitoring systems is disadvantageous in yet another way. Little statistical information can be made available to the user. For example, in diabetic healthcare maintenance, changes or fluctuations that occur in blood glucose levels during a day, a week, or longer period can provide valuable information to a diabetic and/or his or her healthcare professional. As previously mentioned, currently available systems do not allow associating blood glucose test results with attendant quantitative information relating to medication, food intake, or other factors such as exercise that affect a person's blood glucose level at any particular point in time. Thus, currently available blood glucose monitoring systems have little or no capability for the generating and display of trend information that may be of significant value to a diabetic or the diabetic's healthcare professional.\nSome currently available blood glucose monitoring systems provide a data port that can be interconnected with and transfer data to a personal computer 48 (e.g., via an RS-232 connection). With such a system and a suitable programmed computer, the user can generate and display trend information or other data that may be useful in administering his or her treatment plan. Moreover, in such systems, data also can be transferred from the blood glucose monitoring system to a healthcare professional's computer either directly or remotely by telephone if both the blood glucose monitoring system (or computer) to which the data has been downloaded and the healthcare professional's computer are equipped with modems. Although such a data transfer provision allows a healthcare professional to analyze blood glucose data collected by a diabetic, this aspect of currently available blood glucose monitoring systems has not found widespread application. First, the downloading and subsequent analysis feature can only be used by system users that have ready access to a computer that is programmed with appropriate software and, in addition, have both the knowledge required to use the software (and the inclination to do so). This same problem exists with respect to data transfer to (and subsequent analysis by) a healthcare professional. Moreover, various manufacturers of systems that currently provide a data transfer feature do not use the same data format. Therefore, if a healthcare professional wishes to analyze data supplied by a number of different blood glucose monitoring systems, he or she must possess software for each of the systems and must learn to conduct the desired analyses with each software system.\nThe above-discussed disadvantages and drawbacks of microprocessor-based self-care health monitoring systems take on even greater significance with respect to children afflicted with diabetes, asthma and other chronic illnesses. In particular, a child's need for medication and other therapy changes as the child grows. Current microprocessor-based self-care health monitoring systems generally do not provide information that is timely and complete enough for a healthcare professional to recognize and avert problems before relatively severe symptoms develop. Too often, a need for a change in medication and/or other changes in therapeutic regimen is not detected until the child's condition worsens to the point that emergency room care is required.\nFurther, currently available microprocessor-based health monitoring systems have not been designed with children in mind. As previously mentioned, such devices are not configured for sufficient ease of use in situations in which it is desirable or necessary to record and track quantitative information that affects the physical condition of the system user (e.g., medication dosage administered by a diabetic and food intake). Children above the age at which they are generally capable of obtaining blood samples and administering insulin or other medication generally can learn to use at least the basic blood glucose monitoring features of currently available microprocessor-based blood glucose monitoring systems. However, the currently available monitoring systems provide nothing in the way of motivation for a child to use the device and, in addition, include little or nothing that educates the child about his or her condition or treatment progress.\nThe lack of provision for the entering of alphanumeric data also can be a disadvantage. For example, currently available blood glucose monitoring systems do not allow the user or the healthcare professional to enter information into the system such as medication dosage and other instructions or data that is relevant to the user's self-care health program.\nThe above-discussed disadvantages and drawbacks of currently available microprocessor-based blood glucose monitoring systems also have been impediments to adopting the basic technology of the system for other healthcare situations in which establishing and maintaining an effective regimen for cure or control is dependent upon (or at least facilitated by) periodically monitoring a condition and recording that condition along with time and date tags and other information necessary or helpful in establishing and maintaining a healthcare program.",
    "l description holds only for the fluctuations, whose evolution is governed by linear wave equations, while the background couples with the usual flat metric.\n\nA new perspective was opened by Goulart in ref. [@b5]. Under certain conditions, the nonlinear dynamics of a scalar field can be described in terms of an emergent spacetime geometry, which is generated by the field itself and determines its propagation. This result extends the analogue gravity approach as the emergent metric now includes the whole dynamics of the system (i.e. even the evolution of the background) and is not restricted to linearized fluctuations. Remarkably, a similar situation occurs in GR: the metric on which a given scalar field propagates is modified by the scalar field itself, thus being a *dynamic* structure. In this framework, the wave propagation becomes a intrinsically nonlinear problem due to the coupling (back-reaction) between the wave and the metric[@b6].\n\nWe note that the emergent metric in nonlinear models does not depend on the scalar field via Einstein's equations and thus they cannot be directly considered as models for Einstein gravity. Nevertheless, they encode in a geometric framework the dynamical interplay between the scalar field and the metric and so they could provide valuable insights into relevant dynamical features present also in GR such as back-reaction effects at a full nonlinear level[@b7].\n\nCompressible, non viscous fluids appear as the ideal candidates for this kind of investigation and in principle, can push the analoguey further. A first connection between nonlinear hydrodynamics and differential geometry dates back to the Riemann's work on discontinuous flows in 1860[@b8]. Since then, there have been numerous contributions, who laid the foundations of the modern mathematical theory of shock waves[@b9][@b10]. In the linear regime, hydrodynamic systems are the prototype model for studies on acoustic black holes[@b1], Hawking radiation[@b2][@b3][@b4] and superradiance[@b11][@b12][@b13][@b14]. Extending to the nonlinear regime, we find that causality is still governed by an acoustic metric[@b15][@b16] and the evolution of nonlinear perturbations can be described through the analogue gravity formalism[@b17]. Acoustic geometries which dynamically depend on the fluid variables appear also in the context of black-hole accretion models[@b18][@b19] and spherically symmetric outflows of nuclear matter[@b20]. Even more importantly, a precise correspondence exists between the gravitational field equations and suitably constrained nonlinear flows[@b21]. Therefore such systems could be exploited to mimic some aspects of black holes dynamics and spacetime singularities[@b22].\n\nAs an alternative to actual flowing fluids, light beams propagating in defocusing optical media are promising models for analogue gravity experiments[@b23][@b24][@b25][@b26][@b27]. The optical field dynamics can be described as a fluid of interacting photons[@b28][@b29] on which linear perturbations, i.e. sound waves, experience an effective curved spacetime determined by the field intensity and phase pattern.\n\nHere, we report an experimental study of the dynamics of *nonlinear* acoustic disturbances in such photon fluids and we provide a geometrical interpretation of the results. We show that nonlinear density waves induce a background flow which, in turn, strongly modifies their propagation. In analoguey with GR, this self-interaction is interpreted in terms of an effective curved geometry generated by the wave itself. In particular, as observed in compressible, non viscous fluids, different points of the wave profile propagate at different velocities leading to the self-steepening of the wave front and the subsequent formation of a shock. This phenomenon is associated to a curvature singularity of the emergent metric.\n\nLet us remark that this work is by no means an attempt to realize a perfect analogue of a realistic gravitational theory. Our backreaction, i.e. how the spacetime is modified by the waves propagating on it, is encoded in a set of nonlinear equations which have not the properties of Einstein's equations. One of the crucial ingredients in GR is the invariance of the theory under diffeomorphisms. An aspect of such symmetry is the possibility of rewriting the equations of motion in a general covariant form, i.e. making them invariant in form under and arbitrary change of coordinates. Our system, and typically non-relativistic theories, do not possess such property. Nevertheless, our geometrical analoguey allows us to describe the self-steepening effect as as the result of the backreaction on the wave by its own effective metric, although such gravitational-like interaction manifestly differs from that of GR.\n\nResults\n=======\n\nPhoton-fluid model\n------------------\n\nWe consider the propagation of a monochromatic optical beam of wavelength *\u03bb*, in a 1D defocusing medium. The slowly varying envelope of the optical field follows the Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger Equation (NSE)\n\nwhere *z* is the propagation direction, *k*\u2009=\u20092*\u03c0n*~0~/*\u03bb* is the wave number and , defined with respect to the transverse coordinate *x*, accounts for diffraction. The term \u0394*n*(\\|*E*\\|^2^, *x*, *z*) describes the self-defocusing effect. In the case of thermo-optical media, the self-defocusing effect arises due to partial absorption of the light, which results in heating effects and, thus, to a decrease in the refractive index. Due to heat diffusion inside the medium, the nonlinearity can be can be highly nonlocal, i.e. the change in refractive index at any position depends not only on the local intensity, but also on surrounding field intensities[@b23].\n\nThe nonlinear change of refractive index \u0394*n* can be described in terms of a response function *R*(*x*, *z*) so that\n\nwith *\u03b3* being a normalisation factor and *I*\u2009=\u2009\\|*E*\\|^2^ the field intensity. In general, *R* depends on the nonlocal processes in the material and by the boundary conditions. In most cases the response is well described by an exponential decay *R*(*x*)\u2009=\u20091/(2*\u03c3*)exp(\u2212*x*/*\u03c3*), where the critical length *\u03c3* defines the degree of nonlocality[@b30].\n\nWhen nonlocal effects are negligible (*\u03c3*\u2009\u2248\u20090), the nonlinear change of refractive index is \u0394*n*\u2009=\u2009*n*~2~\\|*E*\\|^2^. In the Madelung formulation *E*\u2009=\u2009*\u03c1*^1/2^*e*^*i\u03d5*^, [Eq. (1)](#eq1){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} can be recast into the continuity and Euler equation for a 1D-Bose-Einstein condensate\n\nwhere the optical intensity *\u03c1* represents the fluid density, is the fluid velocity (*c* is the speed of light) and the propagation direction has been considered as a time coordinate . In [Eq. (4)](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, the optical nonlinearity corresponds to the repulsive atomic interactions, while the last term is the analogue of the quantum pressure[@b31]. By applying the \u2202~*x*~ operator to [Eq. (4)](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} and neglecting the quantum pressure term, we obtain\n\nwhere we have defined the bulk pressure .\n\n[Equations (3)--(5)](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, [](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, [](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} are exactly the Navier-Stokes equations in a 1D compressible, non viscous fluid. While in the limit of small amplitudes, density perturbations behave as sound waves (i.e. linear fluctuations of the mean fluid flow), in the full nonlinear problem (3)--(5) a density wave cannot propagate forever. The wave profile steepens and eventually develops a discontinuity in a finite time[@b9][@b10][@b32]. The nonlinear term, *v*\u2202~*x*~*v*, determines the steepening rate of a wave. In real fluids this can be balanced by diffusion or viscosity, while in the photon fluids by the quantum pressure and nonlocality. If these terms are dominant over the nonlinearity, the self-steepening will be completely smoothed out. However, when these effects are sufficiently weak, a shock wave can form as the steepening wave approaches the discontinuity, where wave breaking occurs.\n\nSelf-steepening regime\n----------------------\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, our system differs from an ideal compressible, non viscous fluid due to the presence of quantum pressure and nonlocal terms. Therefore, in order to clearly observe the self-steepening of density waves, it is necessary to operate in a regime where the above effects are negligible. We shall see that this regime is tightly related to the so-called phononic behaviour in the dispersion relation of small amplitude fluctuations. Let us briefly recall some results. The dispersion relation can be directly obtained by linearizing the nonlocal [Eq. (1)](#eq1){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} around an homogeneous background, and by Fourier transforming[@b23]. We obtain\n\nwhere *K*\u2009=\u20092*\u03c0*/\u039b is the wavevector of the mode, \u03a9 its angular frequency, is the wave velocity and . Using the definition of bulk pressure given in the previous section, we have that . Hence, *c*~*s*~ can be readily identified with the (constant) sound speed in the photon-fluid.\n\nIn the case of local media (*\u03c3*\u2009=\u20090), [Eq. (6)](#eq12){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} has the form of the Bogoliubov dispersion relation in a Bose gas, where *\u03be* plays the role of healing length[@b33][@b34]. The characteristic length *\u03be*, separates two different regimes. At low energies \u039b\u2009\u226b\u2009*\u03be*, we find the linear dispersion \u03a9\u2009\u2248\u2009*c*~*s*~*K*, typical of sound waves while at high energies the *K*^2^ quantum pressure contribution is dominant. In the case of nonlocal nonlinearities (*\u03c3*\u2009\\>\u20090), an approximate linear dispersion is recovered by requiring both \u039b\u2009\u226b\u2009*\u03be*, and \u039b\u2009\u226b\u2009*\u03c3*. While these considerations can be hardly extended to the case of strongly nonlinear waves, they roughly identify the operational regime where the effects of the quantum pressure and nonlocal terms are less significant.\n\nNumerical simulations\n---------------------\n\nThe hydrodynamic representation of the NSE suggests that many features of acoustic waves can be investigated in the photon fluid using a pump-probe optical setup. Here a wide, flat-top beam (the pump) is injected into a defocusing thermo-optic medium together with a smaller Gaussian beam (the probe) tilted at an angle with respect to the pump. The superposition between the two beams generates an interference pattern, whose wavelength and amplitude are respectively determined by the tilt angle and relative intensities of the two beams. In the photon-fluid context, the pump beam corresponds to an homegeneous background fluid with constant density and zero flow velocity, while the interference pattern induces a density wave propagating on such background.\n\nWe numerically solved the NSE [Eq. (1)](#eq1){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} with input conditions similar to the experiments described below and those shown in ref. [@b23]. A pump pulse of 532\u2009nm and beam diameter 1\u2009cm is injected in a nonlinear defocusing medium with nonlinearity *n*~2~\u2009=\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u200910^\u22126^\u2009cm^2^/W. A probe beam is overlapped at the input with a small 0.02 deg angle. For the sake of clarity, here we use a narrow probe, so that our the envelope of our initial condition has a width comparable to the wavelength.\n\nFor a small input amplitude (less than \\~10% of the pump), the density wave is in the linear regime. The initial condition splits in two parts propagating in opposite directions. As previously discussed, the evolution after separation is governed by Bogoliubov dispersion relation[@b23][@b27][@b29] which allows us to interpret these waves as Bogoliubov particles. At long-wavelengths, dispersive effects (quantum pressure) are negligible and density waves move at constant velocity (the sound speed) with no distorsion of their shape. An example of these dynamics is shown in [Fig. 1(a)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. For higher probe powers the density waves enter into the nonlinear regime. After the separation, the density profiles steepen on the front edges and then breaks into higher frequency ripples, [Fig. 1(b,c)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. This is due to the fact that the propagation velocity is now a function of the density, and therefore is different for different points in the profile. Since points of higher density propagate faster than points at lower densities, the profile increasingly steepens in the course of time. These results well reproduce the typical evolution of a density wave in ideal compressible, non viscous fluid up to the formation of flow discontinuities[@b32].\n\nAs we will clarify later, the velocity of a point in the nonlinear wave profile is given by *v*\u2009\u00b1\u2009*c*~*s*~, that are now both dependent on the density. [Figure 1(d)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows lineouts of the sound speed *c*~*s*~ and background fluid velocity *v* corresponding to the wave profiles displayed in [Fig. 1(c)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. As can be seen, both speeds are significantly modified due to high amplitude of the propagating waves. In particular, the density wave induces locally a nonzero flow velocity.\n\nWe recall that in linear acoustic analogues, the spacetime curvature is determined by the fluid velocity and the sound speed profiles (spatially homogeneous flows provide a flat spacetime). Here the background flow is induced by the wave itself. In other words, the initially flat spacetime geometry is curved by the waves, which are then in turn distorted by the spacetime metric. This suggests the possibility to achieve a geometrical description of the dynamics, as a kind of backreaction on the wave by its own effective metric.\n\nExperiments\n-----------\n\nThe self-steepening of waves can be experimentally observed by using a similar setup to ref. [@b23] (see [Fig. 2(a)](#f2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). A 532\u2009nm, CW laser beam is divided in two parts and then recombined forming a Mach-Zehnder interferometer setup. The more intense pump beam (1\u2009W/cm^2^) forms the background fluid and the weaker probe beam in injected at a small angle so as to create, by interference, a density wave in the photon fluid. Both the pump and probe beams are focused into the sample using a cylindrical lens pair to create an elliptical beam with a very wide major axis diameter of 1\u2009cm and a minor axis diameter of 260\u2009*\u03bc*m. The propagation dynamics occurs along the major axis and our system can be considered as one-dimensional. By controlling the relative angle and power of the two beams we created an interference pattern of the desired wavelength and modulation depth. This density wave is injected in a nonlinear sample, a 18\u2009cm long cell filled with a methanol/graphene solution. Methanol has a negative thermo-optic coefficient but a low absorption in the visible. Nanometric graphene flakes (7\u2009nm average size) are therefore dissolved in the medium in order to increase absorption. The absorbed energy is released in the form of heat, which in turn provides the defocusing nonlinearity via thermo-optic effect[@b23]. After the cell, the probe beam profile (i.e. the density wave) is isolated from the pump with a spatial filter, consisting of a pinhole in the far-field of the first lens of an imaging telescope and is then imaged onto a CCD camera.\n\nAs discussed in previous sections, a strong self-steepening effect can be observed if the quantum pressure and nonlocal terms play a marginal role, at least in the first stages of propagation. Therefore, the wavelength of the sound mode must be chosen such that \u039b\u2009\u226b\u2009*\u03be*, and \u039b\u2009\u226b\u2009*\u03c3*. The critical lenghts *\u03be* and *\u03c3* can be estimated by studying the propagation of small-amplitude fluctuations in our fluid for different pump powers (see measurements in ref. [@b23] and Methods for a description of the technique). For our experiment the nonlocal length *\u03c3* over which the nonlinearity extends has been measured to be 110\u2009*\u03bc*m and, for the chosen pump power, the healing length is *\u03be*\u2009=\u200985\u2009*\u03bc*m[@b23]. Here, the probe beam is incident at a 0.02 deg. angle, giving rise to a density wave with a wavelength of about 1\u2009mm. The beam width has been chosen in order to observe several periods of the density wave.\n\nTypical profiles of the photon fluid density waves are shown in [Fig. 2(b)](#f2){ref-type=\"fig\"}. For low amplitude input the wave evolves as a linear perturbation of the background and preserves the initial sinusoidal shape (blue curve). Given its long wavelength, the density wave evolves as a sound wave with a constant sound speed determined by the background density. This regime and the complete dispersion curve have been exhaustively characterized in ref. [@b23]. Let us remark that even such a small-amplitude wave would eventually end up to steepen and produce a shock. This is simply due to the fact that nonlinear effects are cumulative as the wave propagates. However, the smaller is the amplitude of the wave, the larger are the propagation distances required to develop observable changes in the wave profiles. For the propagation distances in our experiments (tens of cm) and the above amplitudes (few percent of the pump), waves display a linear behaviour.\n\nFor higher input amplitudes (50% of the pump) the wave distorts and self-steepens (red curve). As expected, the self-steepening observed in the experiments ([Fig. 2(b,c)](#f2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) is less severe than that observed in the simulations in the case of local media (e.g. in [Fig. 1(b)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), while is qualitatively similar to that shown in ([Fig. 2(c)](#f2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, where the nonlocal medium response has been included. This clearly show how self-steepening is affected by a nonlocal nonlinearity, which has the effect of smoothening out any sharp features in the nonlinear response. Numerical simulations with the initial condition used in [Fig. 1](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"} but including a nonlocal response with the same *\u03c3*, indeed confirm this interpretation \\[thin black line in [Fig. 1(c)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\].\n\nGeometrical description\n-----------------------\n\nThe connection between the nonlinear fluid equations and a \"dynamic\" acoustic metric can be shown by writing [Eqs (3](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, [4](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, [5)](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} in terms of the Riemann invariants, *\u03c8*~\u00b1~\u2009=\u2009*v*\u2009\u00b1\u20092*c*~*s*~, where *c*~*s*~ is the local speed of sound usually defined as . In terms of these variables we obtain two advection equations\n\nwhere . [Eq. (7)](#eq17){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} simply state that the two variables *\u03c8*~\u00b1~ are conserved along the characteristics curves defined by *dx*/*dt*\u2009\u2261\u2009*c*~\u00b1~. Therefore, in a nonlinear wave the constant quantities *\u03c8*~\u00b1~ are propagated in spacetime at the characteristic speeds *c*~\u00b1~\u2009=\u2009*v*\u2009\u00b1\u2009*c*~*s*~, so they travel at the speed of sound relative to the flowing fluid. As in linear acoustic analogues, the characteristic curves demarcate the region of causally connected events. The acoustic line element can be written as\n\nand thus the characteristics of the fluid equations coincide with the null geodesic defined by the acoustic metric *g*~*\u03bc\u03bd*~, whose coefficients depends on the fields *\u03c8*~\u00b1~.\n\nThe solutions *\u03c8*~\u00b1~ implicitly define the sound cone and so generate the above metric. However, depending on the initial consitions, they may generate other background structures. This is a difference with respect to GR, where spacetime metrics are the only background structures possessed by the theory and necessary to describe the dynamics. Other trivial solutions of [Eq. (7)](#eq17){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} are: i) *\u03c8*~\u00b1~\u2009=\u2009*const*, which corresponds to a fluid with constant density and constant flow. This would obviously modify the wave dynamics, while remaining globally unaffected waves propagating on it; ii) waves propagating in a single direction. These particular solutions fails to provide a metric, since they would define an incomplete sound cone. We could just define a single set of trajectories, the positive or the negative characteristics, by tracing the path in space-time of a hypothetical observer. In other words, we have not a causal structure that could be associated with a conformal class of Lorentzian metrics. However, for most of the initial conditions, [Eq. (7)](#eq17){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} admit travelling wave solutions propagating in opposite directions, which thus generate a metric (8).\n\nNotice that the advection [equations (7)](#eq17){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} are weakly coupled through the coefficients *c*~\u00b1~\u2009=\u2009*c*~\u00b1~(*\u03c8*~+~, *\u03c8*~\u2212~), which depend on both Riemann invariants. Therefore, general wave solutions cannot be decomposed *exactly* into a sum of two *independent* left- and right-going waves as in the linear wave equation, where *c*~+~\u2009=\u2009\u2212*c*~\u2212~\u2009=\u2009*constant*. Nevertheless, it is possible to reconstruct an *approximate* solution which well describe the observed self-steepening dynamics up to the shock formation.\n\nConsider an arbitrary density profile propagating on an uniform density state, *\u03c1*~0~, with zero flow (*v*\u2009=\u20090). After a short transient, the initial profile separates into two parts propagating in opposite directions, similarly to what observed in [Fig. 1(b,c)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. When such right-going and left-going profiles are sufficiently well separated, they can be considered as nearly *independent*, in the sense that the right-going wave is not affecting the evolution of the left-going wave and viceversa. So, the complete solution is well approximated by the superposition of two components propagating in opposite directions. Such components, known as simple waves, can be thus independently calculated. Simple waves are particular solutions of [Eq. 7](#eq17){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} obtained by setting one of the Riemann invariants equal to a constant[@b32]. The known Riemann invariant allows us to eliminate one of the advection equations and thus to write the other in just one physical variable, either *\u03c1* or *v*. Consider the particular solution, *v*(*\u03c1*)\u2009=\u20092(*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u2212\u2009*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*~0~)), i.e *\u03c8*~\u2212~\u2009=\u2009*const*. The corresponding advection equation is identically solved and that for *\u03c8*~+~ can be written as \u2202~*t*~*\u03c1*\u2009+\u2009(3(*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u2212\u20092*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*~0~))\u2202~*x*~*\u03c1*\u2009=\u20090. This equation describes a nonlinear wave propagating with velocity *c*~+~\u2009=\u2009(3(*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u2212\u20092*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*~0~)). Similarly, we can now consider *v*(*\u03c1*)\u2009=\u2009\u22122(*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u2212\u2009*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*~0~)), i.e. *\u03c8*~+~\u2009=\u2009*const*. and obtain the nonlinear advection equation for a wave propagating in the opposite direction with velocity *c*~\u2212~\u2009=\u2009\u2212(3(*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u2212\u20092*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*~0~)).\n\nThe complete solution can be reconstructed via linear superposition of these two elementary components. We remark that such reconstruction cannot provide an exact solution of the nonlinear problem. On the other hand, when the wavepackets are sufficiently well separated their mutual coupling is negligible and then the solution is very well approximated by the superposition of the two independent simple waves calculated above.\n\nNotice that any point in the wave profile (i.e. a point at a given density) propagates with constant velocity *c*~\u00b1~(*\u03c1*)\u2009=\u2009*v*\u2009\u00b1\u2009*c*~*s*~, so the characteristics are now straight lines. Such waves can be conveniently regarded as a superposition of a density fluctuation propagating relative to the fluid, at the speed of sound and the movement of the fluid (induced by the wave itself) with velocity *v*. Since for right-going waves (and viceversa for left-going waves), the propagation velocity of a given point in the wave profile increases with the density: points of higher density propagate faster than points of lower density leading to self-steepening of the wave front. In a finite time the wave front will become vertical, implying an unphysical multivalued solution. The time and position in which the profile will exhibit such discontinuity is determined by the condition that *\u03c1*(*x*, *t*) has an inflection point with a vertical tangent line, i.e.\n\nThe latter conditions have a geometrical interpretation in terms of the characterisitics/null geodesics. Since the velocities *v*\u2009\u00b1\u2009*c*~*s*~ are functions of the density, two characteristics of the same family (right-going or left-going) emanating from two spacetime points are not parallel and intersect at a finite time. As the gradient of the solution profile becomes increasingly steep, two characteristics become closer and closer. At the point of intersection, the solution is multivalued and the gradients are infinite (gradient catastophe)[@b32].\n\nThe resulting spacetime is not null complete. In fact, the family of half null geodesics, (i.e. geodesic curves which have one endpoint and have been extended as far as possible from that endpoint), having a finite proper length, can be parametrized by a finite affine parameter[@b35]. Consequently, propagating waves reach a singularity in a finite time.\n\nThe appearence of a singularity can be explicitly shown by direct calculation of the Ricci scalar *R*, which in two dimensions fully determines the spacetime curvature. Considering the superposition of the two independent simple waves calculated above, we have *c*~+~\u2009=\u2009(3(*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u2212\u20092*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*~0~))\u2009=\u2009\u2212*c*~\u2212~. Substituting into [Eq. (8)](#eq19){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, the metric takes the diagonal form\n\nIn two dimensions the Ricci scalar is twice the Gaussian curvature , which for the above diagonal metric is given by\n\nBy using *u*^1/2^\u2009=\u2009\u00b1(3(*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u2212\u20092*c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*~0~)) and *c*~*s*~(*\u03c1*)\u2009\u221d\u2009*\u03c1*^1/2^ we get\n\nwhich, accordingly to [Eq. (9)](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, diverges at the shock formation point.\n\nThe fact that a multi-evaluated density (or flow velocity) would imply the divergence of *R* can be deduced from the definition of the acoustic metric, as already introduced in linear acoustic analogues. However, in linear models a singular spacetime can only be externally imposed, e.g by choosing a background with a topological defect. Here instead, a curvature singularity emerges spontaneously in a finite time, starting from a constant, homogeneous background. This is due to the *nonlinear* interplay between the propagating wave and the underlying metric, whose curvature is generated by the wave itself. Moreover, it is worth noting that since *\u03c1*~0~\u2009=\u2009*const*., *R* has the same spatial dependence of the \"quantum pressure\" term in [Eq. (4)](#eq21){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}, . This is an interesting point that warrants further investigation. In linear analogue models, the quantum pressure is usually neglected in the derivation of the acoustic metric and, when is taken into account, is responsible for the high-energy breaking of Lorentz invariance. In a similar fashion, our geometrical analoguey has been established in the ideal pure nonlinear system (quantum pressure neglected). As a result, the nonlinear interaction (self-steepening) is the manifestation of the curvature of a dynamic spacetime metric generated by the wave. As time evolves, the wave (density) profile changes, thus modifying the curvature of the corresponding metric which, in turn, will affect the density profile. While at the initial stages of propagation the curvature/steepening is indeed negligible, it will forcibly increase in time and eventually will become infinite (singularity). It is known that in the presence of quantum pressure the singularity will never form: when the curvature becomes sufficiently strong, the quantum pressure comes into play and will eventually counterbalance the curvature. In this context, the fact that *R* has the same spatial and temporal dependence as the quantum pressure is not at all a coincidence. The perfect spatiotemporal matching between curvature (nonlinearity) and dispersive term (quantum pressure) is the unavoidable condition to have the compensation between the two effects, necessary to prevent the formation of the singularity. The resulting shock waves can be thus seen as spacetime structures of maximal --though finite-- curvature.\n\nIn [Fig. 3](#f3){ref-type=\"fig\"} we plot the numerically calculated characteristics, corresponding to the (*x*, ) trajectories of points with the same density *\u03c1*, for the case of the nonlinearly propagating acoustic wave of [Fig. 1(c)](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. Although the presence of quantum pressure and nonlocal effects prevent the formation of a singularity, the convergence of the characteristics is a clear indication of an increasing spacetime curvature, in agreement with the ideal picture based on the emergent metric.\n\nDiscussion\n==========\n\nQuantum fluids such as BECs, polariton fluids and photon fluids have been proposed as platforms to study analogue gravity effects. To date these have focused on the propagation of weak amplitude density waves on top of a given background configuration. This has led to a series of important kinematic studies, including e.g. glimpses of Hawking radiation[@b36]. It is possible to extend these experimental models into the nonlinear regime where the background curved geometry determining the propagation of the waves is generated by the waves themselves. This self-interaction can thus be interpreted as kind of gravitational influence on the wave by its own effective metric. Such analogue nonlinear models are truer in spirit to general relativity, where mass distributions evolve in a spacetime metric that is modified by mass itself. However, as previously discussed, our backreaction is encoded in a set of nonlinear equations which are manifestly different from Einstein's equations. In spite of this fact, in the presence of particular symmetries there is a precise correspondence between the gravitational field equations and the fluid dynamics. Therefore, suitably constrained photon-flows could be exploited to mimic the dynamics of gravitation black holes, spacetime singularities included[@b22], and cosmological solutions[@b37][@b38].\n\nMethods\n=======\n\nHere we briefly describe the technique to estimate the relevant system parameters, *\u03c3* and *\u03be* (notice that the sound speed, *c*~*s*~, and the healing length, *\u03be* are not independent parameters: *c*~*s*~*\u03be*\u2009=\u2009*\u03c0c*/*kn*~0~. The characterization measurements are reported in ref. [@b23].\n\nAs the beam propagates through the nonlinear medium, the phase velocity of the sound wave is determined by *v*~*ph*~\u2009=\u2009\u03a9/*K* with \u03a9 given by [Equation (6)](#eq12){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} and hence is a function of the system parameters. For low pump power, the nonlinear thermo-optic effect is negligible and the medium behaves essentially as linear optical system (*c*~*s*~\u2009\u2248\u20090). In this limit, using [Eq. (6)](#eq12){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} and the relation , we calculate the phase velocity *v*~*ph*0~\u2009=\u2009(*c*/2*kn*~0~)*K*.\n\nAs the pump beam power is increased we therefore expect to observe a spatial shift of the sound wave pattern by \u0394*S* due to the increase of the phase velocity. The shift is given by \u0394*S*\u2009=\u2009(*v*~*ph*~\u2009\u2212\u2009*v*~*ph*0~)*Ln*~0~/*c*, where *L* is the length of the medium, so the distance along which the wave has propagated. By using [Eq. (6)](#eq12){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} and the above expression for \u0394*S* we obtain\n\nBy measuring \u0394*S* for different values of the pump power and for different wavevectors of the interference pattern, *K*, we may therefore use [Eq. (13)](#eq29){ref-type=\"disp-formula\"} to fit the data and estimate both *\u03c3* and *\u03be*. As a function of the wavevector *K*, one can recognize the finite limit \u0394*S*\u2009\u2192\u2009*\u03c0*/*k\u03be* for *K*\u2009\u2192\u20090. Therefore for long wavelengths, the shift is observed to saturate to this limit value. The local vs. non-local nature of the nonlinearity is instead visible for short wavelengths.\n\nAdditional Information\n======================\n\n**How to cite this article**: Marino, F. *et al.* Emergent geometries and nonlinear-wave dynamics in photon fluids. *Sci.

    "l, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Dr. Lane and CMA on the grounds that Dr. Lane is immune from liability for reporting potential child abuse to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).[1] For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\nThe record reveals the following relevant facts. On December 29, 1988, a DCFS social worker informed the plaintiff's that a former foster child had made allegations that when he lived with plaintiff's, Steve sexually abused him. The DCFS social worker advised plaintiff's that they were being investigated and that they must have their own two-year-old child, Daniel, evaluated for evidence of sexual abuse.\nThat same day, plaintiff's retained attorney Stephen Komie (Komie) to represent them. Katherine informed Komie that DCFS wanted Daniel admitted to Mt. Sinai Hospital or La Rabida Hospital to be evaluated for sexual abuse. Katherine further informed Komie that DCFS would not accept an outpatient medical evaluation performed by the plaintiffs' own pediatrician. Komie recommended that plaintiffs take Daniel to Dr. Lane, whom he described as an expert in the field of the sexual abuse of children.\nSubsequently, Dr. Lane conducted a physical examination of Daniel, taking cultures from Daniel's rectum, throat and penis. Dr. Lane had the cultures delivered to DOL for evaluation. Dr. Lane then wrote a report of her examination which stated that Daniel was a healthy, normal child who showed no signs of sexual abuse. Plaintiffs paid Dr. Lane $600 for her services, at the rate of $150 per hour.\nOn December 31, 1988, a DOL employee wrote a report stating that Daniel's throat culture tested positive for gonorrhea. On January 3, 1989, Dr. Lane learned of the laboratory report, telephoned Komie to notify him of the positive test result, and later advised Steve of the test result by telephone. Dr. Lane then wrote a letter to plaintiffs verifying her conversation with Steve, stating her intent to confirm the test result, and requesting that she reculture Daniel, and treat him if the retest was positive. Later that evening, Dr. Lane reported the test result to the DCFS Child Abuse Hotline.\nOn January 5, 1989, Dr. Lane informed a DCFS investigator that Daniel's throat culture was positive for gonorrhea of the throat. The investigator filed a report with the DCFS, and the DCFS notified the office of the Cook County State's Attorney that Daniel was infected with gonorrhea.\nA petition for Adjudication of Daniel's Wardship was subsequently filed in the Juvenile Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County. The petition alleged that Daniel was sexually abused based on Lane's diagnosis that Daniel was infected with gonorrhea.\nOn January 18, 1989, a temporary custody hearing commenced before Judge R. Morgan Hamilton to determine whether Daniel should be removed from his parents' custody pending trial on the petition of wardship. Dr. Lane testified pursuant to plaintiffs' subpoena that at the time she examined Daniel, he was two-and-one-half years old. She took a physical and social history and performed three cultures, checking Daniel for various sexually transmitted diseases. Dr. Lane followed standard procedures in preserving a specimen for gonorrhea. Dr. Lane then instructed a nurse to take the specimen to *36 DOL, which is located in the building in which she practices.\nDr. Lane testified that she received the test results on January 3, 1989, revealing a positive culture for gonorrhea from Daniel's throat. Dr. Lane called plaintiffs, but failed to reach them. Dr. Lane then called Komie's office and told him the results of the test and asked Komie where and when she could locate the plaintiffs. Komie told Dr. Lane that the plaintiffs would be in his office that day, and that she could talk to them there. That afternoon, Dr. Lane received a telephone call from Steve and she told him the results of the culture.\nDr. Lane testified that it is difficult to find a positive gonorrhea culture, because it has a high false negative rate. She stated that 50-60% of the time she treats a patient for gonorrhea even if the test is negative. Dr. Lane stated that a positive result of a test for gonorrhea is accurate 99.3% of the time.\nDr. Lane testified that gonorrhea is absolutely a sexually transmitted disease. Based on her examination of Daniel, she felt that he was a healthy child, but stated: \"When I received the results of the culture, my mind changed dramatically.\" Dr. Lane then called the DCFS hotline because she strongly felt that Daniel had been sexually abused.\nAt the conclusion of the temporary custody hearing, the trial court ordered Daniel removed from plaintiffs' home and placed in a foster home. Daniel remained in foster care for eleven months.\nIn December 1989, following a trial on a petition for adjudication of wardship, the court returned Daniel to the custody of the plaintiffs. The transcript of the full custody hearing is not included in the record on appeal.\nPlaintiffs filed their original complaint seeking damages against defendants on November 30, 1990. Plaintiffs fifth amended complaint, filed on September 27, 1993, included allegations against Dr. Lane, CMA, and DOL for negligence, conspiracy to commit fraud, fraud, and breach of contract.\nAt her discovery deposition taken by plaintiffs on June 23, 1993, Dr. Lane testified that prior to her involvement in the plaintiffs' case, she previously testified as an expert in two sexual child abuse cases at the request of attorney Komie. One of the other cases was a licensure proceeding related to the high-profile case against day-care-center owner Sandra Fabiano in 1988. Dr. Lane did not testify at Fabiano's trial in 1990.\nDr. Lane stated that after examining Daniel, she sent the specimens to DOL for gonorrhea cultures, informing DOL that Daniel was a two-and-a-half-year-old child. Dr. Lane did not instruct DOL as to what diagnostic tests to use in the cultures. Although she is familiar with the test normally used for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhea, she does not know the name of the test. Dr. Lane stated that to her knowledge, DOL is a certified laboratory, supervised by a board certified pathologist, and employing qualified technicians. She assumed that the test had been properly administered. Dr. Lane agreed that it is possible to get a false positive in a culture for Neisseria gonorrhea.\nAfter receiving a report of a positive culture on Daniel's throat for gonorrhea, Dr. Lane telephoned DOL, then telephoned plaintiffs' home, then Komie. Dr. Lane eventually reached the plaintiffs, and told Steve that the result of Daniel's throat culture was positive, that Daniel needed to be treated and then recultured, and that she needed to see Daniel as soon as possible. Steve responded that Daniel was out of state, and asked Dr. Lane if there was a mistake in the culture. Dr. Lane told Steve that she would reculture Daniel, but that because the test result was positive, she had to report the result to the DCFS hotline. Dr. Lane did not suggest that she would confirm the results of the test prior to reporting it to the hotline. Steve stated that he was \"in a lot of trouble\" and attempted to dissuade Dr. Lane from calling the DCFS. Dr. Lane wrote a letter to plaintiffs confirming what she told Steve on the telephone; that she would reculture and wanted to treat Daniel, and requesting that they bring him to her office on January 4, 1989.\nLater that evening, Komie called Dr. Lane at home and pleaded with her not to call the DCFS. Komie did not inform Dr. Lane that *37 the plaintiffs had discharged him as their attorney earlier that day, on January 3, 1989. Dr. Lane reported the test results to the DCFS hotline at approximately 11:00 p.m. on January 3, 1989.\nDr. Lane stated that her testimony at the deposition was consistent with her testimony at the January 18, 1989, temporary custody hearing.\nDr. Lane and CMA filed a motion for summary judgment on the following grounds: (1) Dr. Lane is immune from all liability pursuant to the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (325 ILCS 5/9 (West 1994)) (Reporting Act); (2) plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from relitigating whether Dr. Lane was an expert in child sexual abuse and from relitigating the accuracy of her testimony at the hearing; (3) plaintiffs cannot attempt to litigate the reason the trial court removed Daniel from custody and whether, but for Dr. Lane's testimony, the ruling would have been different; and (4) plaintiffs waived the right to allege that Dr. Lane's involvement at the hearing caused damaged because the plaintiffs, not the State, subpoenaed Dr. Lane to appear at the hearing. Defendants supported their motion by: (1) an affidavit executed by Dr. Lane; (2) the transcript of the temporary custody hearing; and (3) Dr. Lane's discovery deposition.\nFollowing a hearing on defendants' motion for summary judgment, the trial court, Judge Kenneth L. Gillis presiding, granted summary judgment in defendants' favor, finding Dr. Lane immune from liability under the Reporting Act. The trial court found that Dr. Lane did not act in bad faith because she followed the proper procedures in conducting the test on Daniel, and in verifying the test result. The trial court determined that Dr. Lane did not hold herself out to be an expert in bad faith. The trial court further found the plaintiffs collaterally estopped from arguing that Dr. Lane was not qualified as an expert at the custody hearing, because Judge Hamilton in fact so qualified Dr. Lane. The trial court further stated that Dr. Lane's involvement in the case came at the behest of the plaintiffs. The trial court did not reach the issue of whether Judge Hamilton's ruling was proper, as the issue \"has factual over-tones * * * inappropriate for a motion for summary judgment.\" The trial court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of Dr. Lane and CMA as to all counts of plaintiff's fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs' timely appeal followed.\nOn appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Dr. Lane and CMA on the grounds that Dr. Lane is statutorily immune from liability for reporting Daniel's test results to the DCFS. Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Lane demonstrated bad faith with regard to her examination of Daniel and subsequent testimony at the temporary custody hearing.\nSection 4 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (Reporting Act) requires \"[a]ny physician * * * having reasonable cause to believe a child known to them in their professional or official capacity may be an abused child or a neglected child,\" to immediately make a report with the DCFS. (325 ILCS 5/4 (West 1992).) Section 9 of the Reporting Act provides immunity from liability to \"Any person, institution or agency\" who makes a report in good faith. The good faith of the reporter is presumed:\n\"For the purpose of any proceedings, civil or criminal, the good faith of any persons required to report * * * suspected child abuse or neglect or permitted to refer individuals under this Act, shall be presumed\" (325 ILCS 5/9 (West 1992)).\nAny such presumption, however, is rebuttable. In Illinois, a rebuttable presumption creates a prima facie case of the particular issue involved. (Lehman v. Stephens (1986), 148 Ill.App.3d 538, 551, 101 Ill.Dec. 736, 499 N.E.2d 103.) In this case, that issue is the good faith of Dr. Lane. It is then incumbent upon the party against whom the presumption operates to come forward with evidence \"sufficient to support a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact.\" (Lehman, 148 Ill.App.3d at 551, 101 Ill.Dec. 736, 499 N.E.2d 103, (citing Franciscan Sisters Health Care Corp. v. Dean (1983), 95 Ill.2d 452, 463, 69 Ill.Dec. 960, 448 N.E.2d 872, 877).) Once evidence is introduced contrary to the presumption, the presumption vanishes, and the burden shifts from the plaintiffs to the defendants. On the other *38 hand, if no evidence is introduced to the contrary, then the prima facie case created under the presumption will prevail, and the defendants would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nPlaintiffs argue that Dr. Lane demonstrated bad faith by: (1) allowing attorney Komie to recommend her as an \"expert\" in the field of sexual abuse of children; (2) undertaking an evaluation of Daniel for sexual abuse for a \"substantial fee\"; and (3) delaying reporting the \"false positive\" gonorrhea test result to the DCFS.\nIn support of their contentions, plaintiffs rely on the allegations of their complaint, and an unsigned, unsworn alleged physician's report attached to their complaint, which states that the Phadebact Omni Test allegedly used by DOL to diagnose gonorrhea is inappropriate for identifying sexually abused children and that the accuracy rate of the test is only 91.2%. In addition, plaintiffs rely upon the affidavit of their own counsel, in which he summarizes his recollection of the evidence presented at the full adjudication of wardship hearing. We note that the entire transcript of the full hearing is missing from the record on appeal.\nSummary judgment should be granted only where \"the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" (735 ILCS 5/2-1005(c) (West 1992).) Although \"the summary judgment procedure is to be encouraged as an aid in the expeditious disposition of a lawsuit [citation], it is a drastic means of disposing of litigation and therefore should be allowed only when the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt. [Citations.]\" Purtill v. Hess (1986), 111 Ill.2d 229, 240, 95 Ill.Dec. 305, 489 N.E.2d 867.\nThe authority relied upon by the plaintiffs is inapposite. Falk v. Martel (1991), 210 Ill.App.3d 557, 155 Ill.Dec. 248, 569 N.E.2d 248, involved a complaint of battery filed against a DCFS investigator. The DCFS investigator filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that he was entitled to statutory immunity pursuant to section 9 of the Reporting Act. This court held that section 9 of the Reporting Act grants a presumption of good faith only to required and permitted reporters, i.e., physicians, and not to other categories of persons listed in the first sentence of the Reporting Act. Thus, the defendant in Falk, who was a DCFS worker investigating a report of child abuse (emphasis in original), is not entitled to a presumption of good faith. (Falk, 210 Ill.App.3d at 560, 155 Ill.Dec. 248, 569 N.E.2d 248.) This court concluded that:\n\"if an allegation of physical abuse by an investigator for DCFS is not sufficient to demonstrate a lack of good faith, the immunity provided by section 9 of the Reporting Act becomes nearly absolute.\" Falk, 210 Ill.App.3d at 561, 155 Ill.Dec. 248, 569 N.E.2d 248.\nUnder the circumstances, the court found the plaintiffs' complaint sufficient to preclude \"at this stage of the proceedings,\" application of the good-faith immunity provision of section 9 of the Reporting Act. Falk, 210 Ill.App.3d at 561, 155 Ill.Dec. 248, 569 N.E.2d 248.\nKuwik v. Starmark Star Marketing & Administration, Inc. (1993), 156 Ill.2d 16, 188 Ill.Dec. 765, 619 N.E.2d 129 is similarly inapplicable. There, the plaintiff, chiropractor, filed a defamation claim against an insurance company that sent a series of letters to its insured, and wrote memos indicating that the plaintiff was not qualified to perform certain diagnostic tests. Our supreme court determined that summary judgment was not properly entered in favor of the insurance company, where genuine issues as to material facts existed indicating that the defendant may have been reckless in sending the letters, and in not conducting a proper investigation into the plaintiff's qualifications. Kuwik, 156 Ill.2d at 31, 188 Ill.Dec. 765, 619 N.E.2d 129.\nIn the present case, there exist no genuine issues of material fact as to whether Dr. Lane acted in good faith in reporting the test results to the DCFS and in testifying pursuant to plaintiffs' subpoena at the temporary custody hearing. The uncontested facts show that: Dr. Lane followed proper procedures in conducting her examination of Daniel; Dr. Lane in good faith submitted the specimen to a certified laboratory for analysis; once Dr. Lane received the results *39 of the test she immediately contacted the plaintiffs, informed them that she must report the results to the DCFS, and offered to retest and treat Daniel; Dr. Lane reported the test results to the DCFS as required by statute after notifying the plaintiffs; Dr. Lane testified at the temporary custody hearing pursuant to plaintiffs' subpoena as to her qualifications and the events surrounding the examination and testing of Daniel; Dr. Lane's deposition testimony is consistent with her trial testimony; and the trial court qualified Dr. Lane as an expert in child sexual abuse.\nWe therefore find that the plaintiffs have failed to overcome the statutory presumption that Dr. Lane acted in good faith in reporting Daniel's test results to the DCFS.\nPlaintiffs further argument that Dr. Lane should not have been qualified as an expert in child sexual abuse at the adjudication of wardship hearing is unavailing. Collateral estoppel bars a party from relitigating issues essential to, and actually or necessarily decided in, a prior proceeding. (American National Bank & Trust v. Village of Libertyville (1995), 269 Ill.App.3d 400, 404, 206 Ill.Dec. 761, 645 N.E.2d 1013 (citing Powers v. Arachnid (1993), 248 Ill.App.3d 134, 187 Ill.Dec. 407, 617 N.E.2d 864.) The record shows that the trial court qualified Dr. Lane as an expert in the adjudication of wardship hearing, and that plaintiffs did not object at the hearing, or afterwards. Thus, plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from relitigating this issue in this later, collateral lawsuit. We find no support for plaintiffs' contention that they detrimentally relied on attorney Komie's recommendation of Dr. Lane for Daniel's examination. We note that while plaintiffs complaint alleges a \"conspiracy to commit fraud,\" plaintiffs fail to name Komie as a defendant.\nFor these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\nAffirmed.\nWOLFSON, J. and BRADEN, JJ., concur.\nNOTES\n[1]  DOL is not a party to this appeal.\n",
    " in extinguishing the fire and thereafter entered the warehouse to make certain that the fire had been entirely extinguished. During the time of the fire and subsequent thereto, officers, agents, and employes of defendant were present and observed the actions of plaintiff and the other firemen. These persons gave no warning to the firemen about the wall of concrete blocks. While plaintiff and other *396 firemen were in the warehouse, the concrete wall collapsed and fell upon plaintiff and other firemen, killing three firemen and seriously injuring plaintiff.\nOn these facts, we are presented with the problem of determining what duty is owed to a fireman who enters upon a landowner's premises in response to a call of duty. The first thing to be recognized is that firemen, policemen, and similar personnel have a status sui generis. Although firemen are frequently described as licensees, it is apparent that they are not licensees in the usual sense of being licensed to enter by virtue of the landowner's consent.[3] Firemen make their entry under license of law, and only in that sense are they licensees.[4] The landowner's consent or protest to a fireman's entry is immaterial, because his consent is unnecessary and his protest is legally unavailing.[5] Numerous opinions and several legal writers have amply explained why firemen cannot be fitted into any of the traditional categories grouping persons who enter upon the land of another.[6] Any rule that flatly categorizes firemen with trespassers disregards the fact that firemen, unlike trespassers, enter rightfully. Any rule that flatly categorizes firemen with invitees or licensees disregards the fact that firemen, unlike either of the latter, may enter premises without invitation or license of the owner. Firemen are regarded as making their entry primarily for the *397 purpose of performing a duty owed to the public.[7] Although the benefit of their services may accrue entirely to an individual property owner, that fact is regarded as incidental.\nSince firemen have the unique status just described, it follows that the duties owed to them may properly be unique. Because the fireman's visit is normally unexpected[8] and because he cannot be excluded, the courts, both in this state and elsewhere, have been reluctant to hold that landowners owe a duty to firemen to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition.[9] There would be an obvious hardship in holding otherwise, because landowners would then be under compulsion to keep all parts of their premises in a condition perhaps uncalled for by the normal use to which the premises are devoted. The rule that firemen must accept the premises as they find them is founded not only upon dictates of a public policy looking to the protection of landowners from undue burdens,[10] with the dangerous situation, to adopt his own means of saving his property, and to delay summoning aid until perhaps greater danger would be threatened to the public.\"\n*398 Since Mulcrone v. Wagner, 212 Minn. 478, 4 N.W. (2d) 97, 141 but also upon a public policy looking to the protection of the general public. As one court pragmatically stated (Suttie v. Sun Oil Co. 15 Pa. D. & C. 3, 5):\n\"* * * An owner, facing knowledge that he risks being mulcted in damages by those whom he summons to aid in the extinguishment of a fire, would be strongly tempted by self-interest to temporize A.L.R. 580, and Hamilton v. Minneapolis Desk Mfg. Co. 78 Minn. 3, 80 N.W. 693, clearly hold that an owner or an occupant of a building owes no duty to keep it in a reasonably safe condition for members of a public fire department, no liability of defendant in the present case can be predicated upon the existence of any defect in the condition of its warehouse wall. The question remaining is whether defendant owed plaintiff any duty at all which it neglected to perform. On this question, the Mulcrone case is the last word in this state. There, the court stated the general rule to be that firemen are licensees, to whom the owner or occupant owes no duty except to refrain from injuring them wilfully or wantonly and to exercise ordinary care to avoid imperiling them by active conduct. When urged to pronounce a more liberal rule, the court stated (212 Minn. 482, 4 N.W. [2d] 99):\n\"* * * it will be observed that Professor Prosser concedes * * * `Firemen * * * are held almost uniformly to enter under a bare license, and to be entitled at most to disclosure of known dangers.'\"\nSince the Mulcrone case did not involve facts showing a failure to disclose a concealed danger,[11] the court was not called upon to determine whether, as Professor Prosser suggests, a landowner has a duty to disclose hidden dangers. Because the court in the Mulcrone case appears to have reserved its decision on that question, it comes to us in the present case as one of first impression. In considering this question, we are well aware that many courts have *399 held that firemen are entitled to be protected only against wilful or wanton injury, and, in that respect, that firemen have been given no greater protection than trespassers and bare licensees.[12] The questionable propriety of treating firemen as if they were licensees or trespassers has already been discussed. At least two legal writers have even criticized the rule that bare licensees are to be protected only against wilful or wanton injury.[13] Mr. Dunnell has described the so-called \"wilful or wanton\" rule as \"a barbaric formula,\"[14] and Mr. Bohlen has ably demonstrated that the rule is founded upon a feudal concept of property rights anachronistic in modern law.[15] Even the rule that firemen must accept premises as they find them has been described by this court as being a hard rule.[16] It is apparent that both in Minnesota and elsewhere the trend of decisions is to avoid extending these harsh rules beyond their present limits, and, at least, in the case of the \"wilful or wanton\" rule, the *400 tendency is to whittle it away with exceptions.[17] At the same time, a respectable body of authority has developed to support the rule that firemen are entitled to be warned of hidden dangers known to the landowner or occupant.

(2d) 547, the New York court of appeals held that if a corporation's agents have knowledge of an unusual hazard existing on the corporation's premises, and, if they have the opportunity, they are under a duty, owed by the corporation, to give firemen warning of the peril.\nIn Smith v. Twin State G. & E. Co. 83 N.H. 439, 449, 144 A. 57, 62, 61 A.L.R. 1015, where the court was confronted with a case where a leak in defendant's gas main resulted in an explosion which injured a fireman, the court stated:\n*401 \"The search for escaping gas naturally took the decedent to the place of peculiar and hidden danger. The defendant knew about it while the decedent did not. It had the duty of due care to warn him about it if it had reasonable opportunity to give warning after the danger existed, and due care called for warning if there was enough chance of danger to the decedent to prompt men of ordinary prudence in the defendant's place to warn him.\"\nIn Mason Tire & Rubber Co. v. Lansinger, 15 Ohio App. 310, 316, the Ohio court of appeals stated:\n\"If the owner knows that a licensee is upon his premises and makes no effort to warn him of the dangers, and the circumstances are such that it would justify a belief that the owner was indifferent to the injuries which might happen to him, the owner is liable. We think the same rule should be applied in favor of a fireman who is on the premises attempting to extinguish a fire thereon.\"\nThe court also stated (15 Ohio App. 319):\n\"* * * In failing to give [a fireman] * * * warning of a hidden peril the owner would be lacking in the common duties of humanity.\"\nCertainly, no meritorious reason can be advanced to justify the view that a property owner, with knowledge of a hidden peril, should be allowed to stand by in silence when a word of warning might save firemen from needless peril. The burden of a duty to warn of hidden perils falls lightly upon the landowner in comparison with the cost of his silence, which is frequently measured in the lives and limbs of firemen and in the sorrow and suffering of their families. Although firemen assume the usual risks incident to their entry upon premises made dangerous by the destructive effect of fire, there is no valid reason why they should be required to assume the extraordinary risk of hidden perils of which they might easily be warned. Two courts at least have held that firemen do not assume such risks, and, for the reasons already stated, we regard that holding *402 as sound. Smith v. Twin State G. & E. Co. 83 N.H. 439, 144 A. 57, 61 A.L.R. 1015; Campbell v. Pure Oil Co. 15 N.J. Misc. 723, 194 A. 873.\nIn spite of the recognized split of authority on the question presented in this case, we believe that the better rule by far is that landowners and occupants alike owe a duty to firemen to warn them of hidden perils where the landowner or occupant has knowledge of the peril and the opportunity to give warning. Having determined that the complaint in this case states a cause of action in tort based upon defendant's alleged failure to warn plaintiff of the hidden danger presented by defendant's unstable warehouse wall, it is unnecessary to consider plaintiff's additional contention that his complaint also states a cause of action based upon alleged violations of two city ordinances.\nAffirmed.\nNOTES\n[1]  Reported in 45 N.W.

    "o inadequate trophoblast invasion \\[[@B4]\\]. Increased oxidative stress and an altered immune response \\[[@B5]\\] at the fetal-maternal interface (Th1 bias) are likely effectors contributing to the development of systemic endothelial and renal dysfunctions in the later phase of the disease.\n\nA series of recent discoveries, specifically the isolation and functional characterization of non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase-homologues in epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast and muscle cells, argue that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are indispensible to both physiological and patho-physiological conditions such as growth, differentiation, apoptosis and senescence \\[[@B6]-[@B8]\\]. The transition from growth to degeneration is finely tuned by the relative concentration of oxidants. For example, in ambient conditions, low levels of H~2~O~2~(nano-micromolar) are necessary for angiogenesis \\[[@B9]\\], while agonist-induced activation resulting in its excessive accumulation (\\> 150--200 \u03bcM) prompts endothelial damage \\[[@B10]\\]. The scheme shown in Fig. [1a](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} depicts the essential role played by ROS in both early and late pregnancy together with the detrimental effect when ROS are produced in excess (oxidative stress).\n\n![**Redox-regulated signaling in normal pregnancies and in Comt-deficient mutant mice**. A, Shows that ROS-induced signaling (Lo ROS) is essential for implantation, establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. The absence of ROS (No ROS) or its excessive accumulation (Hi ROS) are detrimental to pregnancy; B, in *Comt*^+/+^mice (WT), 2ME2 production is highest at late pregnancy and blocks vascular growth by destabilizing HIF-1\u03b1 in physiological pregnancies. The absence of 2ME2 in *Comt*^-/-^animals (mutant) would increase oxidative stress and stabilize HIF-1\u03b1. The stability of HIF-1\u03b1 is dependent upon critical concentration of H~2~O~2~which determines the functional state of prolyl hydroxylases (PHD).](1477-7827-7-4-1){#F1}\n\nDuring pregnancy, the maternal energy demand increases significantly to sustain the growing fetus. This demand is met via a substantial increase (30--50% compared to the non-gravid state) in the uterine blood flow in the pregnant women \\[[@B11]\\]. Consequently the \\'shear stress\\' (dragging frictional force generated by the blood flow), is negotiated by endothelial cell (EC)-derived vasodilatory agonists, nitric oxide (NO^.^) and prostaglandin I~2~. The release of vasodilators from EC is controlled by mitochondrial Ca^+2^-influx (ATP-GPCR and ISP3-ER pathways) as well as NADPH oxidase-dependent mitochondrial O~2~^.-^production. The pregnancy-induced adaptation of ROS-regulated Ca^+2^signaling in the mitochondria of EC is essential for re-establishing physiological laminar flow in uterine vessels \\[[@B12]\\]. In extreme circumstances, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca^+2^homeostasis due to high ROS, could lead to Ca^+2^overload of the matrix, triggering apoptosis. The first indication of a mitochondrial involvement in preeclampsia/eclampsia came from a case report where the frequency of the disease was high in a family with inborn mitochondrial defects \\[[@B13]\\]. A number of *in vitro*studies on a hypoxia-reoxygenation model of placental culture and plasma oxidant/antioxidant analyses further pointed to mitochondrial involvement by suggesting that ROS could influence trophoblast fusion, migration and apoptosis relevant to preeclampsia \\[[@B14],[@B15]\\]. In support of this, it is pertinent that homozygous deletion of *SOD-2*(MnSOD) has the most severe effect on embryonic development in mouse pregnancy compared to that of *SOD-1*and *SOD-3*knockouts \\[[@B16]\\].\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are key mediators of growth factor-dependent redox-regulated signaling in angiogenesis. While \\> 90% of O~2~is reduced in mitochondria, NADPH oxidases (Nox2, gp91phox) are the major source of ROS in endothelial cells \\[[@B17],[@B18]\\]. The O~2~^.-^generated at the outer surface of the plasma membrane is internalized through ion channels, a process which increases the intracellular Ca^+2^release, activating mitochondrial O~2~^.-^production. Thus, NADPH oxidases and mitochondria together perpetuate a cascade of O~2~^.-^production in vascular endothelial cells \\[[@B19],[@B20]\\].\n\nHypoxia inducible factor -1\u03b1(HIF-1\u03b1) is a dynamic partner of the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF-1 which is essential for angiogenesis \\[[@B21]\\]. Irrespective of the oxygen tension (hypoxic or normoxic), the stability of HIF-1\u03b1 is determined by it ligation to von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein, VHL \\[[@B22]\\]. Once bound to VHL, HIF-1\u03b1 undergoes ubiquitination prior to proteosomal degradation. A prerequisite for VHL binding is site-specific hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1 by prolyl hydroxylases (PHD). The transfer of these hydroxyl moieties to HIF-1\u03b1 by PHD requires O~2~and 2-oxogluterate as co-substrates, together with reduced iron (Fe^+2^) and ascorbate as cofactors \\[[@B23],[@B24]\\]. Therefore, prolyl hydroxylases act as negative regulators of HIF-1\u03b1 since active PHD-Fe^+2^promote HIF-1\u03b1 binding to VHL and subsequent degradation. It is apparent that the enzymatic activity of PHD could be modulated by the relative concentration of co-substrates as well as cofactors. Indeed, the stability of HIF-1\u03b1 in angiotensin II-treated vascular smooth muscle cells under normoxic conditions is due to H~2~O~2~-mediated reduction in cellular ascorbate concentration and increased Fe^+3^\\[[@B25]\\]. It is noteworthy that commonly encountered ROS such as O~2~^.-^and OH^.^anions are short-lived and, owing to their limited diffusion capacity, fail to cross the plasma membrane except through ion channels. Therefore, the majority of cellular ROS-effects are mediated via relatively stable H~2~O~2~. This is consistent with genetic, molecular and pharmacological experiments \\[[@B26]-[@B29]\\] suggesting that H~2~O~2~plays a central role in stabilizing HIF-1\u03b1 by converting PHD-Fe^+2^to PHD-Fe^+3^.\n\nClinical research on preeclampsia (PE) is mostly restricted to observations, *in vitro*correlative studies on placenta and patient serum samples originating from mid-to-late gestation when the disease is fully manifested, long after it initiates at early pregnancy. These problems have underlined the necessity for animal models of PE where the progression of pathogenesis can be traced through longitudinal studies from early pregnancy. Three recently developed mouse models for PE \\[[@B30]-[@B32]\\] exhibit hallmarks of the human disease. In one of these models, the critical symptoms of PE (hypertension, proteinurea due to glomerulosclerosis and fetal resorption) were ameliorated by continued treatment with an SOD mimetic, tempol \\[[@B31]\\], suggesting that the PE-like symptoms of these model mice are precipitated by disruption of redox-regulated signaling during pregnancy. A further link between redox-regulated signaling and human pregnancy pathology has been provided by the most recently developed animal model for PE \\[[@B32]\\]. The homozygous deletion of Catechol-O-methyl transferase (*Comt*^-/-^) in pregnant mice results in the loss of 2ME2 which has direct involvement in redox-regulated signaling.\n\nDespite the advantage of targeted disruption of a specific gene (*Comt*) in the mouse system and similarities in placental cell types in mouse and human, this animal model might be insufficient in understanding all aspects of the development of human preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. The limitations of the mouse model for preeclampsia stem from intrinsic differences in the physiology of mouse and human pregnancies \\[[@B33]\\]. The mode of implantation \\[[@B34],[@B35]\\] differs between mouse and human; there is shallow decidual invasion in mouse compared to extensive uterine remodeling by invasive trophoblasts in human. In addition, the uterine spiral arterioles in mice are remodeled by maternal factors rather than by invasive trophoblasts in human pregnancies \\[[@B36]\\], and the endocrine control of mouse pregnancy is mediated by a limited number of placental hormones compared to that of human \\[[@B37]\\]. Moreover, the short gestation period (3 weeks) in mice, the incomplete development and birth of altricial young are unlike human pregnancies \\[[@B38]\\]. All of these factors limit mouse pregnancy as a model system for human fetal growth restrictions.\n\nHypothesis\n----------\n\n2-methoxyestradiol 2 (2ME2) is a natural estradiol metabolite which induces microtubule depolymerisation, inhibits angiogenesis and is a promising anticancer drug by virtue of its ability to target leukaemia cells while sparing normal lymphocytes \\[[@B39]\\]. At first glance, the fact that the absence of the 2ME2 metabolite in mutant (*Comt*^-/-^) pregnant mice results in placental hypoplasia and vascular pathology to the extent that it leads to a preeclampsia-like phenotype \\[[@B32]\\], might appear surprising. However, a paradigm shift with recent discoveries \\[[@B6]\\] of redox-regulated signaling pathways for angiogenesis \\[[@B10],[@B17],[@B18],[@B40]\\] are consistent with vascular pathology of 2ME2-deficient (*Comt*^-/-^) pregnant mice \\[[@B32]\\]. It should be emphasized that the temporal requirements for 2ME2 vary in normal pregnancies, its production being extremely low in early pregnancy during the peak period of angiogenesis and high later (third trimester) when placental development is complete \\[[@B41],[@B42]\\].\n\nGenetic and biochemical studies have established that 2ME2 is a potent inhibitor of MnSOD \\[[@B43]-[@B45]\\] and facilitates superoxide (O~2~^.-^) production \\[[@B44]\\]. In wild-type pregnant mice (*Comt*^+/+^), the inhibition of MnSOD at late pregnancy (dpc 12--14 in mouse, equivalent to peak activity of 2ME2 at 30--35 wks of gestation in human) would disengage NADPH-mitochondrial cross-talk by reducing critical H~2~O~2~concentration. Lack of sufficient H~2~O~2~will activate PHD (PHD-Fe^+2^) for hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1.OH) and subsequent degradation \\[see Fig [1b](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and ref \\[[@B25]-[@B29]\\]\\]. This notion is in agreement with the established anti-angiogenic role of 2ME2 \\[[@B46]\\] and inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 in WT (*Comt*^+/+^) animals \\[[@B32]\\]. Such down-regulation of vascular remodeling and placental growth under normoxic conditions at late pregnancy by 2ME2 (peak activity at 30--35 wks of gestation), is presumed to be a physiological necessity to circumvent uncontrolled placental invasion which otherwise could potentially lead to pregnancy pathology. Premature induction of 2ME2 during early hypoxic growth (4--12 wks of gestation) would be detrimental to pregnancy, since the stability of HIF-1\u03b1 in early hypoxic development is essential for vascular remodeling. Additionally, 2ME1 (2-methoxyestrone), an analogue of 2ME2 having no inhibitory effect on MnSOD \\[[@B45]\\], would fail to correct 2ME2 deficiency in *Comt*^-/-^mice.\n\nIn *Comt*^-/-^mice, the lack of inhibition of MnSOD under normoxic conditions (late pregnancy) would facilitate untimely accumulation of H~2~O~2~which is essential for HIF-1\u03b1 stability \\[[@B32]\\]. H~2~O~2~would block hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1 by inactivating PHD (PHD-Fe^+3^) \\[[@B25]-[@B29]\\] This view (Fig [1b](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) is supported by the observation that HIF-1\u03b1 is labile following injection of 2ME2 in *Comt*^-/-^mice at late pregnancy \\[[@B32]\\]. Increased accumulation of H~2~O~2~(\\> 200 \u03bcM/L) under normoxic conditions together with stable HIF1-\u03b1 is sufficient to inflict vascular pathology in *Comt*^-/-^mice. Moreover, HIF-1\u03b1 is a potent mediator of myeloid cell (monocytes and macrophages) infiltration at the sites of inflammation \\[[@B47]\\] and lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis \\[[@B48]\\]. Therefore stable HIF-1\u03b1 alone at late pregnancy could elicit preeclampsia-like phenotypes in *Comt*^-/-^mice.\n\nTesting the hypothesis\n----------------------\n\n### Oxidative stress as an inducer of preeclampsia in genetically normal mice\n\n1\\. Preeclampsia symptoms in normal pregnant mice could be created by treating the animals with 2ME2. 2ME2 which peaks at third trimester of pregnancy, is a pro-oxidant and rather than an antioxidant as proposed by Kanasaki *et al*\\[[@B32]\\]. Therefore, 2ME2 could be detrimental to early hypoxic development. This hypothesis could be tested by daily injection of 2ME2 beginning at 3 days prior to pregnancy up to dpc 17 of gestation in genetically normal mice.\n\n2\\. Since 2ME2 at low concentrations (0.3 mM) in combination with rotenone \\[[@B44]\\] is a potent inducer of O~2~^.-^, the same experiment could be repeated to ensure maximum oxidative effect. The logic behind using the combination is that rotenone at low concentration (50 nM) would direct O~2~^.-^production by diverting electron flow from complex 1 of the electron transport chain to O~2~, while non-toxic concentrations of 2ME2 (0.3 \u03bcM) would synergistically facilitate O~2~^.-^accumulation by inhibiting SOD \\[[@B44]\\].\n\n### Elimination of oxidative stress in mutant mice by antioxidants/activator of PHD\n\n1\\. The proposed oxidative damage induced by accumulation of H~2~O~2~in *Comt*^-/-^mice could be rescued by treating the animals with synthetic MnSOD/catalase mimetics. Synthetic MnSOD/catalase mimetics have been shown to exhibit both SOD and catalase activities, and some are more potent, stable and cytoprotective than the native antioxidant enzyme SOD \\[[@B49]\\].\n\n2\\. The preeclampsia phenotype in mutant animals could be rescued by treating the animals with ascorbate or specific activators of PHD (benzopyran or an inhibitor of diacylglycerol kinase, R59949).\n\nImplications of the hypothesis\n------------------------------\n\nWhile oxidative stress has been proposed to be central to placental pathogenesis and systemic vasculo-endothelial damage in human preeclampsia and a hypertensive mouse model \\[[@B31]\\], the concept has never been tested in genetically-defined animal models. The hypothesis and tests described here might contribute to the understanding of pathophysiologic sequences leading to the clinical manifestation of preeclampsia. Moreover, ROS are indispensible to angiogenesis, trophoblast differentiation, invasion and embryogenesis. The proposed experiments would help evaluate the importance of redox-regulated signaling in early as well as late pregnancy.\n\nAbbreviations\n=============\n\n(ATP): Adenosine triphosphate; (GPCR): G protein-coupled receptor; (ISP3): Inositol triphosphate; (ER): Endoplasmic reticulum; (*Comt*): Catechol-O-methyl transferase; (2ME2): 2-methoxyestradiol 2; (HIF-1\u03b1): Hypoxia induciblefactor-1\u03b1; (SOD-1, 2 and 3): Superoxide dismutase 1--3; (MnSOD): Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase; (PHD): Prolylhydroxlases; (ROS): Reactive oxygen species; (WT): wild type.\n\nCompeting interests\n===================\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nAuthors\\' contributions\n=======================\n\nThe authors discussed the clinical importance of different mouse models for preeclampsia and developed the hypothesis; SB wrote the manuscript.

They exist because we have some business problems we are trying to get help with.\n\nAnd so if you start with the idea of, here's the business objective, AND there's all the data in the world. What kind of an application would you build? The analogy I always use is Waze, which is to me, like the application that showed the best value or the best shift that will happen. When you go from a world in which you have an app that shows you red lines, yellow lines and green lines on a hard to read Google Maps, which is kind of what used to be in the traffic apps, if you remember them. To Waze. No one cares what the traffic is like in that area. What they care about is finding the best route to get home. How do I get from A to B as quickly, easily as possible. And tell me my options in doing that. And then feed me, turn by turn what I should be doing.\n\nWaze is in an application that gives more than it takes. I think, and it won't just be about AI. But I use AI because it helps illustrate a new way to think about Apps in a world in which the necessary data already exists and you can connect to it. And because I think AI will be in the center of most of these Apps. But the idea that the data exists in the world, the fact that we can understand the business objectives, and the fact that we can go be an external applications for them that actually would be, will give more than they take. I think we'll define a generation of applications.\n\nI think it's the same. I think it's this shift. It's this next generation of applications. It's this idea that applications are not only going to become smart, and they're going to understand what you're trying to accomplish and they're going to give you choices but they're going to be highly adaptive in doing that. They're going to redefine themselves. They'll be a set of constraints around the organization model. The way the organization wants to run its business, but within that, an individual, the way they want to work, they way they want to connect with the data, I think these applications will be incredible. The great applications of the future will be incredibly personalized.\n\nSo from a building software perspective, it's wildly exciting. It's a huge joy I think for software developers to think about all these tools that exist now to build applications that truly delight people and then marry them to what they're trying to accomplish.\n\nFrom a business perspective, it'll be incredibly challenging because it is really hard when you're an existing player of a huge legacy footprint to make the shift in a non-disruptive way to your business. Another angle \u2013 that I started to hear from COO's about it over the last couple of years, was, \"explain to me again why we're signing a three year subscription contract?\" I understand users go up or down. Why is this not more of a model I can end up where it's more consumption based? There was a huge shift in going from perpetual license to subscription. But going from subscription to consumption based will be the next thing I think customers start looking at.\n\nAnd it won't be a clean one. I think it's going to be some sort of an evolution of subscription that has a more flexible model based on the idea that if the roll-out doesn't go as fast as we thought, you don't pay as much. It goes faster, you pay more. And there's some boundaries around it. But I think more and more that's going be the expectation driven because of people like Amazon. And I think that will be a good change, because it will tie vendor and customer success together more closely....which is a good thing. But the change will be tough shift.\n\nThe coming data war\n\nMy wife and I were driving somewhere and she pointed out a building with \"Google Cloud\" on it. She goes, \"What's Google Cloud? Is that different than Google?\" And I said, \"Well, Google is like a lot of organizations, they're trying to build a big infrastructure businesses. And of course the 800 pound gorilla in that space is Amazon. But everybody else is trying to chase that business and catch up. I hear about Alibaba now, Google of course, Oracle keeps talking about it, IBM's in the space, Microsoft's in the space.\n\nI just never know with Google....is it self driving cars, is it glass, it's always hard to figure out where they go next with their business. But if they're serious about being a cloud infrastructure player, given where they are today, I don't know how they do that. You have to find a way to create some kind of critical mass for that. And at some point, you have to look around and say, well, what do we, how do we do that? Doing it organically is tough.\n\nThey have great AI services but I don't think that's going make anybody move over to their infra structure. Because AWS has AI services as well. So does Microsoft.\n\nSo it seems to me that someone like Google has to go and acquire something like Salesforce. And I don't know if it'll happen or how it would work. I don't know culturally how it would set. But they need to think about if you're going go in the cloud wars, how do you create enough content data, critical mass, where people say, I already have those apps and that data in your system, I might as well look at what else they have and consider it.\n\nThat's where there's always going to be the tricky thing for the evolution as they look at what the next big business opportunity is, how do it get there if they're five or ten years behind the organization that's already the leader in the space?\n\nI think they have to acquire something big to do it. I think if they got really worried about Microsoft, I can see someday, both Amazon and Google saying, \"Oh crap. We have to go buy Salesforce.\"\n\nThey need a strong application footprint. And frankly there isn't really a strong applications footprint on the ERP side for cloud yet. There's Netsuite and Microsoft has ERP,. Workday is probably the strongest independent ERP in the Cloud.\n\nAnd so how do you think about that? And there's a decent ecosystem around Salesforce. Including some ERP stuff and some industry stuff that with the right investment could become significant in that space.\n\nSo I think both Amazon and Google could both wake up one day and say, we need to go get that. Which could become an interesting acquisition war. And if they start, Microsoft will probably jump in as well.\n\nIt's a good question. And yet I think what Facebook realized with I think Microsoft is realized it's the war of the future is a war for data. It's how do you get this data? I think Microsoft buying LinkedIn was smart. I think them buying Github was smart. They clearly get that the future is about the data. And the data that sits out there that they don't own, that is really fundamental to business is the customer data. And honestly, Salesforce owns that.\n\nSo, that to me, if you're Google or Amazon, that's kind of the next thing you think about.\n\nComments\n\nWe ran yesterday Part 1 of the interview with John Wookey. Part 2 below focuses on his view of the future of the industry.\n\nThe next-gen of apps will \"give more than they take\"\n\nAI is being delivered now as us to incremental functionality on existing applications. But we still haven't done what I expect, which is, at some point, step back and say\u2026what if we had not built any applications at all, and we exist in a world in which the data around the business largely all available It may not be in your core CRM system or your ERP system, it may be sitting on some social site somewhere, but it's accessible in some way.\n\nAnd you understand that your opportunity is to, if you understand the business context well enough, go get that data. And rather than ask people to type data into a system and then spit it back at them, {which is honestly what most applications do) That's what most apps really do...ask for data and then give it back to you.\n\nNow....you can start with the objective and build a very different kind of app. The idea is that you say, \"I have this quota for this quarter, and I need to hit this target, or I have this many customer support tickets I need to get through.\" Or, \"This is my objective for a marketing campaign.\" Or, \"This is my my manufacturing objectives for the month.\" Or, \"This is the cost model we have in place for supply chain.\" Or, \"This is the period of time in which we want to close our books.\" Or, \"This is our recruiting target for HR.\"\n\nThere's a million business systems out there.

If hearts were exposed to BDM during ischemia (at 35 degrees C) and were then reperfused BDM-free, ATP/ADP- and CrP/Cr-ratios were decreased. However, if hearts were exposed to BDM during cold ischemia and were then reperfused BDM-free, extramitochondrial ATP/ADP- and CrP/Cr-ratios were unchanged. These results confirm earlier studies on the tissue protective action of BDM but point to the importance of low temperature exposure to BDM for its beneficial effect.",

    " with BOO that loaded 30 ml/kg of water. A drug was administered orally. Changes in systemic blood pressure and heart rate were studied in conscious BOO rats using the tail cuff method. The voiding frequency was increased and the average voided volume was decreased in BOO rats compared with normal rats. Nicorandil (1 mg/kg), cromakalim (0.1 mg/kg) and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN; 1000 mg/kg) decreased voiding frequency significantly in BOO rats. Nicorandil also increased the average voided volume significantly. Although cromakalim and ISDN at doses effective at decreasing voiding frequency caused blood pressure to drop, nicorandil at an effective dose did not affect blood pressure and heart rate. Nicorandil improved frequent urination without changing the blood pressure. These results suggested that a hybrid of a K(ATP) channel opener and nitric oxide donor, nicorandil was bladder-selective compared with vasculature in BOO rats.",

Also, I think it is relevant to include the fact that this view contains many other joins (15-20) so I am trying to optimize by reducing that number in any way.\nEDIT Also I feel it is relevant to add that there are linked servers involved and these two tables are on different databases; another reason why I am trying to reduce the number of joins.\nAny insight or help would be appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA:\n\nAs with most performance questions, you need to test the different versions on your data on your system.  But, I think the aggregation query you want is:\nSelect m.ID, value1, value2, value3, value4\nfrom main_table m left join\n     (select ID,\n             MAX(case X when 'this' then value end) value1,\n             MAX(case X when 'that' then value end) value2,\n             MAX(case X when 'third' then value end) value3,\n             MAX(case X when 'other' then value end) value4\n      from other_table\n      group by ID\n     ) A\n     on A.ID = m.ID;\n\nThe advantage of aggregation is that adding more values does not much change the performance.  Adding new joins can affect performance, so at some point, the aggregation will probably outperform the joins.\n\n",

    "USINESSMAN Al Gore can sell to the highest bidder. But Gore has never presented himself as a capitalist seeking to maximize profit but as an activist on issues he deems to affect the future survival of America and the planet earth. On this basis he received a Nobel Prize. He has also held high office based on the premise that he understands the value and importance of US interests. In this context, for him to sell knowingly to an anti-American station that supports terrorist groups in informational terms and a front for a country whose (legitimate) interests require the maximum sale of oil and gas\u2014in other words directly contrary to Gore\u2019s supposed agenda\u2014is, to put it politely, hypocrisy.\n\nMoreover, in the statement by his business partner the emphasis was on how this deal served the values of Gore and his enterprise and that he found the purchases to be politically congenial to his worldview. A purely profit-making deal did not require such a statement. I argue then that the \u201cjust doing business\u201d argument does not apply.\n\nI am not exaggerating al-Jazeera\u2019s radicalism. I admit that the English-language al-Jazeera is far more cautious than the Arabic-language version and that it has been more open than other historic state-controlled media. Nevertheless, as someone who daily monitors al-Jazeera and knows people behind the scenes, I repeat my contention that it is an organ with a political line. Of course, this is not present in every story or every minute.\n\nBy way of full disclosure, I have rejected invitations to appear on al-Jazeera because they are always with one or two extremists and I have seen how the host slants the program in their favor. Former employees have also spoken out on this point. Subtle propaganda is still propaganda. Unlike other, Western mass media outlets (at least historically) al-Jazeera is not in business to make money but to purvey a political stance. That fact is certainly not a secret.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019ve read to the end you deserve a reward so here it is. Although I have to be vague here, responsible and reliable people in Israel have discovered in the past that al-Jazeera tried to send into Israel as staffers people with active connections to terrorist organizations. I have heard the names and details on this point and am satisfied that it is true. There\u2019s more of this kind of thing than I\u2019ve explained here.\n\nProfessor Barry Rubin is director of the Global Research in International Affairs (GLORIA) Center and editor of the Middle East Review of International Affairs (MERIA) Journal.

And for this she had been taught to thank--not\nchance, not merely heredity, but the determination of her father.\n\nLeopold Stornway had a passionate adoration for physical beauty,\nregarding it as almost the first of virtues. And more, he was proud of\nthe vast importance he placed on bodily perfection, for was it not a\nreverence characteristic of classic Greece? There it was--in the records\nof the never-to-be-forgotten days of antiquity--that Leo found all his\nchief interests. Egypt, Mesopotamia, Rome, and, above all, Greece--each\nin turn had been the lands of his adoption. Pericles and C\u00e6sar, Cyrus\nand Rameses, Shalmanesur and Hiram, were the gods of his idolatry. He\nknew and cared more concerning the triumphant fortunes of Semiramis; the\nproceedings of Antigone or of Theseus; the adventures of Agamemnon or\nAchilles, of Hector or the pious \u00c6neas at the Siege of Troy, than he did\nof the doings of those who sat in the seats of the mighty in his own\ncentury.\n\nThe happiest time of his life had been his three years at Oxford. Almost\nimmediately on leaving college he married--simply because she was\nbeautiful as any Greek statue--a young woman considerably beneath him in\nstation, and possessed of an unconquerably violent temper. He knew right\nwell, even during the period of his deepest infatuation, that he had\nfound no mate for his soul. He was sadly conscious that that part of his\nmind--of his spirit--that he cared for most deeply, never would--never\ncould--unveil itself to the scrutiny of his chosen life-long companion.\n\nTo feed his intellectual affections, he relied on the continuance of his\ncollege friendship with the brilliant and vivacious Morris Kenyon. But\nherein he was doomed to disappointment. After a brief spell of vain\nstruggling for literary recognition in London, Leo settled down,\ncontentedly enough, to obscurity in the depth of the country. There he\nspent peaceful days occupied in highly intellectual yet miserably paid\nwritings. Each year he became more of a recluse--more out of touch with\nthe times. Morris Kenyon likewise altered. Plunged into the vortex of\ntown life, seeing and doing everything, going everywhere, courted and\nflattered and popular, not only on account of his great wealth but for\nhis more personal attractions--every year he drifted farther from being\nthe Morris of yore. The change in both men was but gradual, and through\nvarying stages of disillusion and disappointment, their ardent\nfriendship was long in dying. But the time came when all ended--even\ncorrespondence ceased.\n\nLeo's marriage was more successful. His wife made strenuous efforts to\nrise to his heights, while his admiration of her stately loveliness\nnever waned. Their first child was a boy, who died in infancy, but ere\nlong little Evarne came as consoler. Leo had wished for a daughter, and\nhad always spoken of the expected baby by the Greek name he had already\nchosen for her--Evarne.\n\nHe had strong theories on pre-natal influence, and put them into\npractice. He read and discussed with his wife poetry and the noblest\nprose works. Everywhere she turned her eyes in her home she beheld\nrepresentations of female beauty--magnificent or placid. On the wall of\nher bed-chamber was a barbaric, richly-hued painting of a Babylonian\nslave-market. It showed a group of women decking themselves before\nentering the Market Square, which could be seen through an opening of\nthe tent. They were of many nationalities, but each in her own way\nrepresented physically perfect womanhood.\n\nNear to this hung a contrasting picture--a delicate symphony in blue and\ngold and snowy white. It was the Catholic's Madonna, with placid lips\nand large uplifted eyes that told of thoughts beyond this world--chaste,\ncalm and pure.\n\nIn the corner of the room by the window stood a large cast of a famous\nantique nude statue of Venus. So perfect was it--the glorious muscles of\nthe body dimpling so gently, so graciously--that even Leo's\nunimaginative wife could find and feel something of what is soothing and\npeace-giving in such beauty. Sometimes of an early morning a narrow beam\nof light would creep into the darkened room between the drawn curtains\nand illuminate just this statue. Then the young wife, lying wakeful,\nwould fix her eyes on the form of the Goddess of Beauty, drinking in its\ndivine influence, remembering her husband's assurance that its\ncontemplation would go far towards making the little daughter that was\nto come likewise strong and beautiful.\n\nAnd Leo's words proved not untrue--a more lovely baby never saw the\nlight. But Evarne's birth cost the mother her life, and after five years\nof happy marriage, Leo was once again lonely.\n\nSince the child's upbringing was thus left to her father, with his fads\nand fancies, it was naturally of a unique nature. Mrs. Jarman--the\nworthy matron whom he engaged to act as nurse to his child, and\ncook-housekeeper to himself--was wont to declare, both to her gentleman\nin person and to the village in general, that she was sure Providence\nhad seen fit to appoint a special angel to guard that blessed motherless\nmite; otherwise no mortal woman could possibly have succeeded in rearing\nit.\n\nMr. Stornway _would_ interfere in what Mrs. Jarman held to be no concern\nof any man--not even of a father. First of all he had been divided in\nopinion as to whether the infant should be wrapped in swaddling-clothes\nin true classical style, or should remain in equally classical nudity.\nThe baby had arrived in the summer-time, so the latter idea prevailed,\nand to Mrs. Jarman's dismay the little one passed the first few months\nof its existence clad in very little more than its own silky skin. All\nthe experienced dame's traditional ideas of long robes, binders,\nshortening-clothes, teething-rings, etc., were swept aside as _modern_.\nThus they were unworthy of a Greek reincarnation, named after the\nfairest of the Nereides, and destined to show an altogether degenerate\nworld what beauty had been in the glorious days of old. With the\napproaching chill of winter even Mr. Stornway agreed to the little form\nbeing warmly clad, but his aversion to modern fashions never could be\nuprooted.\n\nThus, though Evarne, as she now hastened to summon the doctor to her\nfather's dying bed, was nigh seventeen, she had never owned a pair of\ncorsets, or worn a dress more tight-fitting than could be managed by\nshaping the material into the waist by gauging or smocking. Indoors, she\ninvariably cast aside her shoes and stockings. She could carry burdens\non her head, could run, jump, and swim with the ease and lightness of a\nyoung Amazon. She slept soundly on a bed hard as wood, and had never\nbeen indulged to the extent of a pillow in her life. Of her own accord\nshe would never have chosen such a harsh _r\u00e9gime_. But at sixteen she\nknew but this one mode of existence, and habit rendered it congenial\nenough.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER II\n\n                            A FRIEND IN NEED\n\n\nDr. Crossways was at home, and at once set out with the girl for \"The\nRetreat.\" He was a surly old man, and, moreover, he had a particularly\nannoying habit--of which no amount of gentle correction could break\nhim--of pronouncing Evarne's name without the final \"e,\" thus\ncompressing it into two syllables instead of three, as it is in the\nmusical tongue of ancient Greece, whence the name was taken. As a rule,\nthe doctor was morose and silent, but on this occasion he had at least\none piece of gossip to enlarge upon.\n\nOn the previous day he had indulged himself in a holiday on the\nstrength of an invitation from the noble lord who had rented the\nshooting on a big estate some twenty miles distant. Evidently it had\nbeen a proud and happy occasion for the little doctor, and it was with\nill-concealed gratification that he rattled off the list of those who\nhad likewise been at this illustrious shooting-party. In it was one\nname very familiar to Evarne--Morris Kenyon. She had never seen her\nfather's early friend, but Leo often dwelt lovingly upon his college\nlife, and Morris Kenyon had been, apparently, the central figure of\nthose never-to-be-forgotten days.\n\nDr. Crossways took his departure from \"The Retreat\" in a state of high\ndudgeon. Accustomed as he was to being called in to cope with every\ntrivial ailment of the local gentry, his professional pride was outraged\nby Mr. Stornway's presuming to approach so very near to Death's portals\nwithout his steps having been carefully guided down the path thereto by\nthe controlling hand of a disciple of \u00c6sculapius. It was absolutely\ninsulting--it really bordered on Christian Science!\n\nAfter parting from the irate doctor, Evarne returned to her father's\nroom. He raised his weary eyelids as she entered, and looked at her with\na troubled, almost remorseful, expression. He had realised vaguely for\nsome time past that he was soon to seek the society of his dearly\nbeloved heroes of antiquity; but not until this solemn medical\nvisitation had he seriously considered the practical earthly results of\nhis soul winging its flight to the fields of Asphodel.\n\nWhen once he should be fairly off upon this interesting journey, his\nyoung daughter would be left quite alone in this world of sin and woe.\nWhat was to become of her? He was singularly devoid of relations. A few\ndistant cousins and a poverty-stricken and decrepit uncle comprised his\nentire stock in that line of goods, while he knew nothing of his wife's\ncommon family beyond the fact that she had a number of half-brothers and\nsisters somewhere in Australia. He had but little money to leave his\ndaughter, and the girl had no training in any means of earning a\nlivelihood. He sighed despondently, as too late he recognised this\nneglected duty.\n\nEvarne sat down by his side, and tenderly stroked his hand. Ere long out\ncame her little bit of interesting news--Mr. Morris Kenyon was within\ntwenty miles of Heatherington.\n\nAt the mention of this familiar name a sudden light flashed into poor\nLeo's worried eyes. Surely for \"auld lang syne\" this once dear friend\nwould look after his young daughter until she was able to support\nherself? Morris was married to a charming wife--unfortunately now a\nconfirmed invalid. Leo had met the young lady at the time of her\nwedding, and been favourably impressed. Surely she would feel for the\ndesolate situation of the young orphan. Filled with this idea, he bade\nEvarne write, telling of her father's condition, and begging that Morris\nwould spare time to come over to visit him.\n\nThe letter was duly posted that night; the answer arrived by return, the\nday after, Morris himself appeared upon the scene. Leo wished to see his\nfriend alone, so on his arrival he was ushered by Mrs. Jarman direct to\nthe sick-room.\n\nWith engaging readiness Morris undertook to watch over the welfare of\nthe dying man's daughter when the time came, and lightly brushed aside\nthe broken thanks. But Leo's gratitude was insistent and touching to\nwitness. He dwelt much upon the otherwise lonely situation of the girl.\n\n\"It is such a weight off my mind,\" he murmured again and again. \"I never\nbefore realised how I have neglected my duty to the child.\" And he\nsighed a deep breath of relief.\n\n\"Now, you must see her,\" he went on, as with a trembling hand he rang a\nbell that stood by his side. In almost immediate answer to the summons\nEvarne appeared in the doorway.\n\nLeo had made no mention of his daughter's striking personal beauty.\nDutiful, unselfish, intelligent--these, and other eminently desirable\nmental and moral attributes had he ascribed to her as recommendations in\nMorris's eyes; but upon the subject of that physical quality that counts\nfor so much more than all the virtues under the sun, the unworldly Leo\nhad been silent. Kenyon had somehow expected to see a stolid, robust,\nand, to him, altogether uninteresting country damsel, and he with\ndifficulty hid his surprise on beholding the fair vision that answered\nthe summons.\n\nEvarne's manner was touched with timidity, but she was not at all shy.\nShe now stood silent and motionless for a moment, surveying her father's\nfriend with a grave and interested gaze. Then, without waiting for any\nintroduction, she advanced towards him with outstretched hand and a\nlittle smile of welcome upon her lips. Kenyon rose, and as he clasped\nher hand and looked with the eye of a connoisseur more closely into\nthose charming features, he was half-ashamed at the consciousness of a\ndistinct sense of satisfaction in the prospect of playing guardian angel\nto such a singularly lovely creature.\n\nHe left \"The Retreat\" that evening feeling thoroughly recompensed for\nthe loss of his half-day's shooting, and that just occasionally the\nfulfilling of the duties demanded by friendship might bring their own\nreward.\n\nLeo Stornway lingered for more weeks than either he or the doctor had\nanticipated, but one morning, just at the beginning of the New Year, he\nwas found lying calm, pallid, pulseless. His race was run. Silently and\nin loneliness the end had come to a silent lonely life.\n\nHis desire had been to dispose of his earthly frame in as classical a\nmanner as possible. The notion he would have really revelled in would\nhave been a funeral pyre on the common, with the villagers solemnly\nrunning races and engaging in wrestling bouts in honour of his Manes, in\ntrue Greek style. This being obviously out of the question, he had set\nhis heart upon the nearest thing possible--ordinary cremation. This\nurgent desire was found solemnly written on the back of a used envelope.\n\nHereupon arose trouble for Evarne. The local undertaker, who\nrespectfully yet promptly put in an appearance, was aghast at her\nintention of arranging for the burning of her father's body. He had no\nsympathy whatsoever with innovations in his staid and respectable\nbusiness.\n\n\"It's the last thing you will ever be able to do for your dear, dead\nparent, Miss Evarne,\" said the dour-looking man. \"Give him a solid\ncoffin--it needn't even be oak, we have good lines in elm and ash--but\n_do_ give him a decent coffin, and have him put under the earth like he\nought to be!\"\n\nMrs. Jarman was of opinion that such a departure from conventionality\nwould be absolutely indecent. She also waxed eloquent in another\ndirection.\n\n\"I allus thought you loved your poor dead Pa. I could 'ave sworn you\nwouldn't 'ave 'urt a 'air of his 'ead!\" she repeated again and again, as\nif Evarne's resolve now disposed of that supposition once and for all.\n\nDr. Crossways was so sure that had he only been consulted in reasonable\ntime neither cremation nor burial would now be under discussion at all,\nthat he declined to offer the least suggestion of any sort. As to the\nvicar and the curate, they called together on a visit of combined\nsympathy and expostulation. Both seemed convinced that a case of\ncremation must prove a serious inconvenience to the Almighty on the\nJudgment Day--even if it did not place Him in an absolute dilemma.\n\nInto this general confusion and misery, Morris Kenyon--summoned by Mrs.\nJarman--descended with all the _eclat_ of the God in the Machine. He\narrived at the very moment when the two rival dressmakers of\nHeatherington, having appeared simultaneously armed with yard measures\nand black patterns, were quarrelling in stage whispers in the porch.\n\nThis weighty matter settled, he proceeded to take all the arrangements\ninto his capable hands. Finally, he sat down to a quiet conversation\nwith the grateful Evarne, the more beautiful for the pallor and\ndistress, concerning her future.\n\nHe learnt that her great ambition was to become an artist. She possessed\ndecided talent, combined with an ardent appreciation of the beautiful,\nbut she was absolutely without training, and had evidently no idea of\nthe long years of steady labour--to say nothing of the \"filthy\nlucre\"--that must be offered at the shrine of Art by would-be disciples.\nLooking at Morris, her big eyes filled with a wistful anxiety, she\ninquired if the little money her father had left could, by the strictest\neconomy, be made to last out until she was able to thus keep herself. If\nnot--and she had evidently come to this conference with her ideas fully\nformed--could she not learn shorthand and typewriting? Even then she\nhoped that, by rising early and working at her painting after office\nhours and on Sundays, she might ultimately earn her living by Art.\n\nKenyon smiled inwardly at the life she thus proposed for herself. If he\nknew aught of the world, the sons of Adam would see to it soon enough\nthat this particular daughter of Eve did not spend her days simply and\nsolely divided between banging the keys of a typewriter and daubing\nsticky colours on a canvas. It was merely his luck that he happened to\nbe first in the field.\n\nTo Evarne he appeared kindliness itself. Certainly she could and she\nshould study Art; and this brought him round to a suggestion that he\nhoped would give her pleasure. He possessed a delightful villa in balmy\nNaples, where Mrs. Kenyon was now staying to escape the rigours of the\nEnglish winter. Evarne must come out and stop awhile with his wife. On\nthe journey through Italy, she should behold all its Art treasures. That\nalone, he assured her, would form a splendid foundation for her later\nartistic training.\n\nDespite her sorrows, Evarne's face lit up with a sudden brilliant light\nof happiness at this altogether delightful prospect, both for the near\nand distant future. Her brightened expression thanked her guardian more\nardently than did her softly-spoken words, and so it was settled.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER III\n\n                     A RICH CASKET FOR A RARE JEWEL\n\n\nDespite the heavy heart with which Evarne bade farewell to her home, the\nweeks occupied by the protracted journey to Naples became a period in\nwhich the light-heartedness of youth gradually conquered sorrow. It was\nso crowded with interest, novelty, fresh sights and experiences, that\nevery week seemed as a month, and her former monotonous existence faded\nrapidly into the background. She seemed a different being, living in a\nstrange, new world. It was a world in which Leo had never had a place,\nso that its progress was in no ways affected by his absence. Evarne\nmourned her father sincerely; shed many tears for him in the silence of\nthe night; and sometimes felt pangs of compunction that novelty and\ninterest should have such powers of overcoming grief. But despite her\nreluctance to accept their aid, these great forces continued their\nhealing work.\n\nAmid its other charms and novelties, this new life was one totally\ndevoid of the necessity of considering ways and means. The girl's\nnatural tastes were far from simple, and the luxury in which Morris\nlived and travelled soon seemed not only congenial, but proper and\ncustomary.\n\nAt Paris, where they stayed some time, she first discovered the subtle\ndelight that lies in the possession of dainty clothes. Her guardian gave\nher _carte blanche_ at both costumiers and milliners, but, through\ndiffidence, she took little advantage of this generosity. Realising\nthis, he visited one of the leading _ateliers_, and gave orders direct\nto madame herself to lavishly stock Evarne's wardrobe.\n\nThus the girl found herself clad in garments totally different to any\nshe had ever seen--let alone possessed. She reluctantly consented to try\nto endure corsets, but very soon gave up the attempt in despair. But\nmadame, far from discouraged, exerted her ingenuity to array the girl's\nlithe yet well-developed young form to the best advantage without any\nsuch fictitious aid, and she succeeded even beyond her expectations.\n\nNever before had Evarne realised the latent possibilities of her own\nfigure. She took unconcealed delight in beholding her reflection in the\nmirror, and positively revelled in her silk linings, silk petticoats,\nsilk stockings, and other hitherto undreamed-of silken luxuries.\n\nVenice was visited, then Ravenna, Florence, Pisa and Rome. Day after day\nMorris was untiring in the thought and care he took for his new toy.\nEvarne, apparently, looked upon his utmost and constant attention as\nmerely part of the accepted routine of the journey, and noted it with\nthe quiet indifference of a spoilt beauty. Yet there was no suggestion\nof coquetry or affectation about the girl. Her mind, as well as her\nperson, was developing on calm, stately and dignified lines.\n\nShe was, in her turn, almost as quietly affectionate and attentive to\nhim as she would have been to her father, but the vainest of men could\nnot have persuaded himself that she made the least effort--open or\ncovert--to at all unduly ingratiate herself into his regard. \"Kindness\nin women, not their beauteous looks, shall win my love,\" sings the wise\npoet, but Morris had been taught so early and so often how many women\nare over-eager to be \"kind\" to a wealthy man, that Evarne's simple ways\nwere attractive by reason of their very novelty. It served as a _sauce\npiquante_, and before Naples was reached he felt more genuine love for\nthis sweet child than he had deemed that well-worn article--his\nheart--would ever again have the good luck to experience.\n\nIt was not until they were actually in the train bound for Naples that\nhe broke to her the information that the looked-for introduction to Mrs.\nKenyon must be postponed for the present.\n\n\"A letter from my wife reached me just before we left Rome,\" he\nexplained. \"She is very nervous, and fears Vesuvius is working up for\nanother eruption. She often thinks that--pure fancy, of course! Anyway\nshe has gone on to Taormina, in Sicily. She will return to Naples when\nshe can muster courage.\"\n\n\"How much she travels about,\" remarked the unsuspecting Evarne.\n\n\"Doesn't she!\" agreed Morris with a grim little smile, thinking of the\ninvalid to whom the daily journey from bedroom to boudoir was an arduous\nundertaking.\n\nThen, noting a troubled expression on Evarne's face as she gazed out of\nthe window at the fast-flying landscape, he asked, with a tiny hint of\nsadness in his voice--\n\n\"Am I such dull company for a bright little girl that you look thus\nsolemn at the prospect of a few more _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ meals?\"\n\nHe took her hand as he spoke. Evarne had long ago got to the point of\nfinding it pleasant to feel her slender fingers enclosed in his strong\nmagnetic clasp. She smiled a little and shook her head slightly in\nresponse to his question, but the fingers he held moved restlessly, as\nif they half-sought to free themselves.\n\nEvarne's mental upbringing and education had been as unusual and\nunconventional--to say the least of it--as had been her physical\ntraining. She learnt the Greek and English alphabets almost\nsimultaneously, and while other damsels of her years were skimming\nthrough novelettes, she had been poring over the eternal and inspiring\nworks of the writers of antiquity. Which form of exclusive mental diet\ncreated, on the whole, the most impracticable, the most false, the most\nmischievous ideas when considered in reference to the stern realities of\nmodern life, it is difficult to say. Infinitely more than the average\ngirl of her age did Evarne know of the possible sins of humanity, of the\ngrim tragedies of history; infinitely less of that perhaps more useful\nfield of knowledge--the restrictions, petty malignity, wickedness, and\ncruelly quick suspicions of modern society.\n\nNevertheless, an instinct told her that there was a vast difference\nbetween travelling under the escort of her guardian to join his wife,\nand in staying with him at his villa without that lady.\n\n\"Do you not think Mrs. Kenyon expects us to go on to her at Sicily?\" she\nsuggested in a hesitating voice, divided between her fear of appearing\nto presume and dictate, and her instinctive shrinking from this new\nprogramme.\n\nMorris read the trouble in the girl's mind, and promptly answered in the\none and only manner that was calculated to set her thoroughly at ease\nagain.\n\n\"When you are comfortably fixed up at Naples I will go on to Taormina\nand bring back the truant. As to you, my dear, forgive my plain\nspeaking, but it is time you seriously started to study for your future\nprofession. There are excellent Art masters at Naples, and you can draw\nin the museum there, but in Sicily there is nothing of all this.\"\n\nAs he had foreseen, this business-like view of the proceeding reconciled\nher to it as nothing else would have done, and it was with a light heart\nand a smiling face that she first set foot over the threshold of \"Mon\nBijou.\"\n\nMorris himself conducted his little guest to the rooms that had been\nprepared for her occupation. The villa was situated on the heights\noverlooking the bay, and Evarne, stepping out on to the verandah, stood\nenthralled by the beauty around. She gazed over the broad expanse of\npurple sea sparsely dotted with small sails, white and brown--at the\nisland of Capri, haunted by the memory of dark mysteries--at the far\ndistant dome of the Italian heavens that crowned all. Then she let her\ndelighted eyes wander over the picturesque roof-tops of the town to the\nsoft yet never-failing canopy of smoke that mingled itself with billowy\nwhite clouds overshadowing the crater of Vesuvius the volcano.\n\nThen she looked at the gardens of the villa itself. There she saw paths\nmade of smooth- pebbles arranged in mosaic designs, winding amid\nstrange and luxurious trees and shrubs and blossoms; saw snowy statues\ngleaming amid the green growth; saw arbours, set near the scent of\norange-blossom or mimosa; while a white marble fountain--an art treasure\nin itself--gaily tossed upwards a sparkling jet of water, which fell\nwith a gentle splash into a deep, carved basin encircled by thick clumps\nof flowers.\n\nOverwhelmed by beauty so universal, so lavish, so abundant, she stood\nrapt until Morris's patience was exhausted. When at length she could be\npersuaded to pay attention to her apartments she found them, in their\nway, to be equally enchanting--equally appealing.\n\nThe chief room was very large, and decorated with an almost florid\nluxuriance. Everywhere the eye turned were pictures, statuettes, carved\nivories, bowls and vases and bronzes--each the embodiment of some\nartistic dream. Everything was profuse--there were many books, many\nmirrors, much gilding, carving, tapestry and embroidery, while masses of\nvivid flowers scented the air.\n\nThe characteristic feature, however, was the mad riot and mingling of\nevery glaring hue, blended together into a bewildering yet exquisite\nharmony. There was mauve and deepest violet, gold, blue, and a touch of\nemerald green. The walls were rich crimson, with creamy white introduced\ninto the deep frieze, whereon dancing maidens were moulded in relief.\nThe whole scheme of colour was daring, brilliant, defiant; it suggested\nlife, youth, vitality, pleasure without remorse.\n\nThe little bedroom opened out from this. It was daintily small, all\nwhite and pale green, the one striking splash of colour being given by a\nbowl of pink roses. Simple, demure, unassuming, it formed a strange\ncontrast to the tropical violence of its neighbour.\n\nAs soon as Evarne was quite alone she placed herself in the centre of\nthe brilliant red room, and pivoting round slowly, surveyed every\nwall--every corner--anew. It was scarcely three months since she had\nleft the austerity of \"The Retreat\"--three months in which she had\nlearnt, seen, done and heard more than in all the previous years of her\nlife. In the dazzling luxury of this room the culminating point of the\nextraordinary difference between the past and the present seemed to be\nattained. Its mad superabundance of wealth and colour, appealing so\nforcefully to the emotions, bewildered the child. Everything about it\nappeared indefinably wrong--almost unnatural--and for a moment the\ninstinctive fear of the unknown gripped her heart.\n\nSuddenly she became apprehensive, afraid of life, of the hidden future\nand what it held. She felt very young, very ignorant, very helpless--a\nstranger not only in a far land, but in a strange world. If only Mrs.\nKenyon had been here to welcome her! Apparently no one about the place\ncould speak a word of English save Morris himself--and, of course, his\nvalet. Even with the bright little maid who was to attend on her, she\nhad found she could only converse by signs. She walked timidly over the\nthick, yielding carpet and leant against the open window, breathing\ndeeply of the fresh, pure air. But a little while and her natural\ncourage rallied, the shadow of depression was tossed aside; she turned\nback into the room, glanced round it once again with sparkling eyes lit\nup by admiration, and all unconsciously broke into a snatch of joyous\nsong.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IV\n\n                      THE WAY OF A MAN WITH A MAID\n\n\nNo trace of the uneasiness of the afternoon remained, as Evarne--clad in\na Parisian triumph, a loosely-falling dinner-gown of fragile black\nchiffon and lace--took her seat that evening opposite Morris in the cosy\nlittle anteroom in which he had ordered meals to be served in preference\nto the ordinary dining-room. She was bright and smiling and\nappreciative, as throughout that first evening beneath his own roof he\nexerted himself particularly to please and entertain her.\n\nNot that this called for much additional effort. Evarne invariably found\nher guardian's society to be more inspiring and exhilarating than his\nown champagne. Even in his ordinary converse with this unusual young\ngirl, the whole of his knowledge of men and matters, his wide\nexperience, his original ideas, all his natural wit and brightness ever\nflowed forth readily and unrestricted. True, this implied not only the\nteachings of some doctrines more or less heretical, but a certain\nelement of looseness of speech and the recounting of anecdotes and\nincidents not usually deemed appropriate to the ears of sweet seventeen.\n\nSo, albeit the previous delicacy of her every thought unavoidably gave\nplace to something less ethereal, her character developed and matured by\nleaps and bounds.\n\n\"Reading maketh a full man, conversation a ready man.\"\n\nThe girl's nature--rendered, perhaps, somewhat over-serious by solitude\nand much deep reading--only needed the mental stimulant of a brilliant\nand clever man's society, to grow rapidly bright and alert. She learnt\nto find interest in many a subject hitherto sealed. From dress to\npolitics--from hard facts to vague fancies--from logical deducing to\nlimitless speculating, her mind was daily led over fresh fields and\npastures new, and rejoiced in this wandering.\n\nMorris and Evarne sat up later that night than they had ever yet done\ntogether. Within these walls Morris alone held sway, and both felt the\nsubtle influence of this state of affairs, so opposed to the constant,\ncomparative surveillance of life in hotels. At length the musical notes\nof the clock chimed the hour past midnight, and Evarne sprang from her\nlow chair, startled by the flight of time.\n\nMorris went upstairs with her. Standing on the threshold of her room she\ntouched the knob of the electric burners, then held out both hands with\nher usual frankness to bid him good-night.\n\nHe held them for a few seconds with that firm and affectionate clasp in\nwhich she so delighted. But then, suddenly transferring both her hands\ninto one of his, he put the first two fingers of his free hand to his\nown lips and immediately pressed them gently upon Evarne's rosy mouth.\n\nIt was at most a mere suggestion of a kiss, yet with a startled glance\nshe jerked her hands away, stepped back quickly, instinctively slamming\nthe door, and Morris, standing outside with a little grimace of\namusement on his countenance, heard the key turn in the lock.\n\nIt was apparently a decided rebuke, yet he went downstairs well pleased\nby the very violence of her reception of this experimental advance.\nEasily enough had he conquered any temptation to kiss the girl as long\nas there remained the fear that she might accept his kisses dutifully,\nas mere fatherly salutes. But the light that had darted into her\neloquent eyes at the simple pressure of his fingers upon those fresh,\nunsullied lips of hers, satisfied him that such an idea--had it ever\nexisted--had been got rid of forever.\n\nEvarne flung herself amid the purple cushions of a big chair and shut\nher eyes. Ere long one idea evolved itself from the tangle of confused\nthought, and placed itself--clearly and shamelessly--before the bar of\nher reason, to be relentlessly judged. Did she indeed owe all that Mr.\nKenyon was doing for her--was giving her--simply to the fact that she\nwas Leo Stornway's daughter, or were her own youth--her beauty--her\nsex--the real forces that prompted his generous actions?\n\nScarcely one second for calm deliberation was granted her. The very\nprocess of actually formulating such a question, brought into conscious\nexistence a knowledge that was both crushing and exalting--terrifying\nand delightful. Doubtless it had been forming itself in her heart and\nbrain for many a long day, but its appearance as a fully-fledged\nfact--something that had to be acknowledged and reckoned with--came with\nthe dazzling sharpness of lightning athwart a summer sky.\n\nWhatever might be the nature of her guardian's feelings, this one fact\nshe knew all too well. Come what might _she_ loved _him_--loved him\ndevotedly--passionately--with all the ardour of youth and a nature\nformed for loving. She realised that if in his eyes she was not the\nfairest amid women, she might as well be possessed of no beauty; if he\ndid not seek and enjoy her society before that of any other creature\nalive, she was worthless in her own sight; if all this divine emotion\nthat had come to her could touch no answering chord within his breast,\nlife would be as a weed, worthless, without colour, perfume or\nsweetness.\n\nTo realise so much during a single tick of the clock was overwhelming!\nInstinctively concealing her face in the cushions Evarne found her\nbreathing oppressed, while as to her heart--it stood quite still for one\nbrief moment, apparently daunted by the magnitude of the additional task\nsuddenly imposed upon it. Then loyally rising to the occasion, it\ncontinued to beat, but with altogether unusual violence and rapidity, as\nwishing defiantly to show that it could bear up with a good grace even\nunder this double duty.\n\nEre long Evarne sat erect again, while then and there her soul soared\naloft into vaporous and shining realms of happiness. Yet no white angel\nwould have veiled its face before this sweet maiden's thoughts and\nideals in her first love. Not for some time did she so much as remember\nthat Morris was married, and even then she was in no mood to actively\nregret Mrs. Kenyon's existence.\n\nThat lady's rights were so unquestioned; Evarne would have shrunk with\nhorror at the mere notion that she should ever come to resent the wife\nas either a rival or a hindrance.\n\nThe fact that she believed Morris was a kind, affectionate and faithful\nhusband, was quite consistent with his returning her love--at all\nevents, love as she conceived it and desired it in return.\nNotwithstanding her classical reading, the girl failed to realise that\nher passion--youthful, virginal and absolutely spiritual, yet ardent and\nenthralling--was an emotion absolutely unknown to any male mind.\n\nLong she sat, enchanted by the fair landscapes of this unexplored\ncountry across whose borders her feet had newly strayed. When at length\nshe nestled down into her soft, scented bed, still the same soft visions\ngladdened her mind.\n\nNext morning, after finishing her coffee and roll, she lay back lazily\nand reflected with the clearer, more rational, thoughts of the early\nhours of the day, upon the one topic that now appeared of paramount\nimportance.\n\nAfter a while Bianca, her little maid, entered, and with painstaking\neffort repeated in English a short message that she had evidently just\nlearnt. \"Master wishes come pay his respects to signorina.\"\n\nEvarne renounced day-dreams and meditations and arose immediately.\nBlissfully independent of hair-curlers or any other such artificial\naccessories, her toilette could be completed with marvellous rapidity.\nNow, in considerably less than half an hour, she issued from her room\nfresh and blooming as a spring flower, and all unconsciously greeted\nMorris with the richest smile she had ever flashed upon him.\n\nHe looked bright and _debonnair\u00e9_ that morning, and it was difficult to\nrealise that he was in fact the contemporary of the girl's father. He\nseemed so glad to behold her again after the few hours' separation,\nasked with such evident interest and concern if she had slept well, held\nher hand for so long and finished by pressing it so warmly between his\nown, that Evarne blushed slightly for very happiness, as with unerring\ninstinct her heart answered its own question, \"He does care--he does--he\ndoes!\"\n\nIn her previous notions concerning both men and women who had attained\nto the mature and dignified age of five-and-forty, she had unconsciously\ntaken it for granted that Cupid always observed a due respect for such\nelderly hearts. True, she was well-informed respecting poor Hera's\ntroubles. Zeus had surely been old--quite old and grey-bearded--yet\napparently he could not ever look down from high Olympus, even on\nbusiness, without his eye falling on some fair damsel who promptly\nbecame entitled to a place amid the crowd of rival fair ones who packed\nthat miraculously capacious heart. Nevertheless, despite this seemingly\ninstructive knowledge, it was only as she grew to know Morris that her\nideas became revolutionised on the subject of middle-aged men who were\nnot divinities, but merely modern and mortal. Now, her guardian's years,\nviewed with the eyes of affection, appeared simply as an additional\nfascination.\n\nAfter a while he proceeded to consult her regarding their plans for the\nday. Would she like to go sight-seeing that morning, or rest after the\nfatigues of yesterday's journey?\n\nEvarne was still amused at this novel notion, evidently entertained by\nMorris, that she was a fragile blossom requiring to be carefully tended\nand cherished. The idea flashed across her: \"How different life will be\nin a year or two when I am all alone in cheap little rooms in London,\nearning a precarious living by Art.\"\n\nThis led her to recall what her guardian had told her last night\nconcerning the two most celebrated Art masters in Naples.\n\n\"They are very different one from another, both in their style of work\nand their method of teaching,\" he had said. \"I will take you to visit\nboth studios, and you can see if one appeals to you more than the\nother.\"\n\nNow she reminded him of this promise.\n\n\"I want to oversee the unpacking of my boxes,\" she said, \"and then, if\nyou please, I should like to visit the studios you spoke of. I want to\nstart working in all seriousness almost at once.\"\n\n\"Oh, no hurry; postpone that!\" was the lazy advice. But she shook her\nhead with righteous emphasis.\n\n\"I don't mean to delay and delay like the foolish virgins in the Bible.\nYou remember that story?\"\n\n\"I can't say I remember those particular damsels,\" rejoined Morris, with\na twinkle in his eye; \"but candidly I maintain that _all_ virgins are\nfoolish.\"\n\n\"That's a very debatable point!\" retorted Evarne, smiling, yet slightly\nbiting her under-lip. \"Seriously, I want to start work at once. Now, let\nme go and put on my hat, and we will place business before pleasure,\nlike good people.\"\n\nThis time Morris wisely checked the response that rose to his lips.\n\nThe rival studios both got visited that day, and the one wherein Evarne\nwas to experience the pangs and delights of the aspiring Art student was\nduly settled upon. It was really somewhat absurd that a mere beginner,\ntotally untrained in the very rudiments of drawing, should be introduced\ninto such an advanced coterie as that of Florelli's.\n\nAs Evarne gazed with admiring yet somewhat saddened eyes at the work of\nthe other students, she felt this herself. To her they all seemed\nfinished artists already! She could certainly get herself up in a loose\noverall plentifully besmeared with paint and charcoal, she could allow a\ncurl of hair to escape from its confining bonds, and thus--as far as\nappearance went--be on an artistic equality with those of her new\ncompanions who were of the feminine persuasion. But would she ever be\nable to work as beautifully as did these young men and women? She\ndoubted it, and yet, appalling realisation! these superior young people\nwere not winning fame and fortune. Alack and alas, they were still\nstudying--still knew their work imperfect--were still striving to\nattain!\n\nThe momentary wave of despair was followed by a somewhat frantic\nimpatience to make an immediate start along this far-stretching road\nthat lay before her. She wanted to return at once to \"Mon Bijou,\" to set\nup a pot or vase and endeavour to make a drawing of it in which the two\nsides should at least decently resemble one another. It was all very\nnice and amusing to sketch pretty little faces with huge eyes, tiny\nmouths and masses of very curly hair; to cover sheets of notepaper with\nangels whose big, feathery wings and vapoury bodies conveniently\nvanished into nothing. But one day in Paris she had tried to make a\ncorrect drawing of a dull, unimaginative vase, and her effort had been\nbrought to an abrupt and highly unsatisfactory conclusion by the\nmuch-employed indiarubber working a hole in the paper.\n\nThat evening, as she and Morris walked in the garden star-gazing, she\nhonestly confided to him her fear that the attaining of artistic\nexcellence would be a longer task than she had at all realised. He did\nnot appear to sink under the shock, but, on the contrary, inquired\ncalmly enough \"what that mattered.\" Hesitatingly, Evarne broached the\nsubject of expense. It was a matter that pressed rather heavily upon her\nmind.\n\nHis answer was unexpected. Half opening his lips as if to speak, he\nclosed them again firmly, looked frowningly into her tremulous, upturned\ncountenance, then suddenly slipping his arm round her waist, drew her\nclosely to him. Her instantaneous impulse was to free herself--not\nbecause she wanted to, far from it--but because she knew well enough\nthat such were dull duty's dictates. Still, she hesitated a moment, and\nthereby lost the strength of mind necessary to maintain strict propriety\nupon its lofty pedestal. On the contrary, she rested quite impassive,\nand Morris felt her soft uncorseted waist heave slightly with the deep,\nquivering breath she drew. Somewhat fiercely clasping her yet closer, in\na second his other arm was also around her, and he was straining the\nflexible young form to his breast with all the abandon of a man who,\nhaving reluctantly practised self-control for long, lets himself go at\nlast.\n\nBut his very ardour and heedless violence frightened Evarne immediately.\nUsing the whole of her considerable strength she endeavoured to break\naway from his clasp. \"Don't, don't!\" she cried in unmistakable\nearnestness, and besides genuine alarm there was a touch of decided\nanger in her voice.\n\nAs soon as she had freed herself she stood irresolute--motionless and\nfascinated--yet obviously prepared at any second to dart away. Indeed,\nunconsciously, prompted by her athletic instincts, she rested, poised\nwith her heels already slightly raised off the earth.\n\nShe looked more Greek than ever at that moment; fitted indeed to form\npart of some legend--\n\n    \"Of deities or mortals, or of both;\n    In Temple, or the dales of Arcady.\"\n\nMorris gazing at her with eager, ardent appreciation, yet read a warning\nthat he must venture no farther that night! Trusting and confiding\nthough Evarne might be, she was too serious, too thoughtful, to accept\nsuch overtures with childish carelessness.\n\nHer expression gradually clouded, for the unknown Mrs. Kenyon rose in\nindignant might before her mind's eye! Morris, guessing the nature of\nsome of her thoughts, knew that in dealing with a young woman possessed\nof such painfully lofty principles, discretion was indeed the better\npart of valour. Moreover, he was far too genuinely attached to her to\nwish to cause her undue distress, and, however strong she might be\nphysically, he knew well that where her feelings were concerned, Evarne\nwas in deed a \"fragile flower,\" to be guarded well and treated tenderly.\n\nSo he just smiled calmly and reassuringly, and into his eyes came that\nkindly, indulgent look that always stirred the girl's very heart.\n\n\"Come, pretty one,\" he said, \"hold my hand quietly, and go on telling me\nthe troubles about the drawing.\"\n\nSuch a sudden change of manner and topic was quite bewildering; Evarne\ncould not accommodate herself to it all with equal rapidity. There was a\nconsiderable pause, while he stood waiting with his hand outstretched.\nThe imprint of very varying emotions passed over the girl's gentle\ncountenance. By the brilliant light of the moon every fleeting\nexpression could be seen, and the look with which she at length laid her\nhand in his could not have been displeasing even to the chaste goddess\nwhose clear rays rendered it visible.\n\nSomewhat hastily Evarne proceeded to chatter about the studio, but her\nnerves were overwrought, and her voice sounded strange to her own ears.\n\n\"Let us go in,\" she urged ere long; \"I'm cold.\"\n\n\"Cold now, perhaps,\" murmured Morris softly, \"but, if I mistake not,\nmagnificently capable of burning with the most divine of all fires.\"\n\nShe made no answer. He could not be sure that she had heard, or if she\nhad, that she understood. Neither was he at all sure that the time had\neven yet come when it was really desirable that she should hear and\nunderstand.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER V\n\n                        THE WILES OF THE FOWLER\n\n\nWithin a week of taking up her residence at \"Mon Bijou,\" Evarne started\nher career at Florelli's. She proved very painstaking, and earnest--so\nmuch so as to cause considerable surprise to the other students, who had\njudged, from the luxury of her attire and appointments, that she was a\nmere _dilettante_.\n\nShe was far and away the most elementary pupil in the studio, and truth\nto tell did not find it particularly interesting to sit alone hour after\nhour in a corner, covering reams of Michallet, and using up boxes of\ncharcoal in repeated struggles to depict gigantic plaster replicas of\ndetached features from Michael Angelo's \"David,\" or innumerable casts of\ntorsos, of arms and legs, hands and feet, in all sizes and\nattitudes--painfully suggestive of amputations.\n\nFor stimulus and encouragement she would peep into the two rooms where\nthe more advanced students were working from life, in one room from the\ncostume model, in the other from the nude. The mental atmosphere of\nthese rooms was so full of energy and enthusiasm that she would return\nwith fresh ardour to her limbs and features.\n\nNot that she was able to devote all her time to the services of the\nexigent Muses, nor, alas! could this pursuit arouse the keenest, most\nengrossing thoughts and energies of which her nature was capable.\nInterest in this, as in everything else in the wide universe, showed\npallid and feeble before the overwhelming and concentrated interest of\nher love for Morris Kenyon. There was something almost tragic in such a\ndomination. Barely seventeen, her heart and mind should have been still\ntoo youthful, too immature, to conceive and sustain such force of\nemotion.\n\nMorris had many friends in Naples, and both visited and entertained\nconsiderably. Evarne, both by reason of her studies and her recent loss,\ncould be prevailed upon to take very little part in any f\u00eates. Still,\nshe started to learn Italian, and was soon able to express her will to\nBianca in all simple matters, and to amuse Morris by her courageous,\nlaughable efforts.\n\nShe fancied herself a perfect little diplomatist, and was blissfully\nunaware that her affection for him was very soon betrayed to his\nexperienced eye by her every look--every word--every action. Under the\ncircumstances, silence on the momentous topic so uppermost in both minds\nwas naturally not maintained for long.\n\nOne night as she sat on a footstool at his feet, spoiling her eyesight\nby delicate fancy work, not speaking much, but at intervals contentedly\nhumming a little song, a sudden impatience at further waste of time took\npossession of him.\n\n\"Evarne,\" he said abruptly, and as the girl in all unconsciousness\nstayed her needle and looked up inquiringly, he bent forward, and\nwithout any warning pressed his lips to hers. Then, shaken from his\nhabitual calm, he placed his hands heavily upon her shoulders and gazed\nintently into her eyes, his expression telling yet more than his\nactions.\n\nShe remained motionless as if hypnotised, her face still uplifted.\n\"Evarne, sweetest little Evarne!\" he murmured after a pause, in accents\ntender and caressing. At the sound of his voice she dropped her head\nslowly lower and yet lower, until it finally rested upon his knee. Still\nshe spoke nothing.\n\nSlipping his arms around her, he forcibly drew her up until her head was\npillowed upon his breast. Then he kissed her again and again, kissed her\nbrow, her hair, her cheeks, her mouth.\n\n\"Darling, are you happy?\" he breathed at length into her ear.\n\nUpon this the girl released herself from his hold, and kneeling erect by\nhis side, looked with wide-open, excited, somewhat horrified eyes\nstraight into his. It was no highly-wrought sentiment either of love or\nindignation that fell from her lips. Simply, yet emphatically, she\ncried--\n\n\"Oh, we mustn't! we mustn't! We were both forgetting your wife!\"\n\nMorris was rather proud of his versatility, and cultivated the art of\nbeing all things to all women. The last lady on whom he had temporarily\nbestowed his affections had, like Evarne, been tactless and\ninconsiderate enough to invoke the memory of the happily absent one at a\ncritical moment. To Evarne's predecessor he had lightly remarked, \"Oh!\nhang my wife, Birdie. She doesn't count.\" Birdie had giggled, called him\na \"naughty man,\" and there had been an end to that topic.\n\nTo have addressed any such flippant answer to Evarne and her clamouring\nconscience would have meant the end of all things. Morris unhesitatingly\ntook the one and only course that would serve his turn now. He adopted\nthe plan of apparent perfect frankness, not only regarding the legal\npartner of his joys and woes, but concerning much else that he had\nhitherto kept hidden.\n\nWith many a sign of great mental struggle, now flashing forth eloquent\nglances, now veiling his eyes from her clear, searching gaze, he made\nconfession of his deception concerning Mrs. Kenyon's promised presence\nat \"Mon Bijou.\" He waxed alternately ardent and pathetic as he\ndiscoursed upon the love he bore Evarne and all that it meant to him,\nvowing that it was the intensity of his affection alone that had\nprompted him to his falsehood. He abused himself so unsparingly, that\nhalf-unconsciously she was moved to utter a pleading little cry of pity\nand expostulation.\n\nThereupon he went on to explain in touching terms that he was but a\nlonely, desolate man, rapidly becoming weary of life, embittered and\nmiserable, until her charm, her sweet goodness, aroused him, awoke\naffection and brought fresh zest into his existence--and so on, and so\non.\n\n\"My wife, well, she was a nicely-brought-up, rather silly girl, pretty\nenough once and good-natured too, but now soured and aged by permanent,\nincurable illness. There is no bond of any kind between us. We have not\na thought in common. There are no children; she can never be either\ncompanion or wife to me. Frail though she is, she has a marvellous\nvitality, a wondrous clinging to life. Such unhappy existences--a curse\nto themselves and others,--are always prolonged. Think of it, dearest,\nthink what it means to a man to be practically tied to a corpse, cut off\nfrom all the joy of living.\"\n\nThen he soared to lofty heights of moralising, told her--or at least\nimplied--that all his hopes of heaven rested upon her gentle influence\nand affection. \"I may seem to others but a hard, somewhat cynical man of\nthe world, yet I have got here\"--and in true dramatic style he struck\nhis breast over the supposed region of a presumably panting heart--\"I\nhave got here a longing for a true woman's disinterested, faithful\naffection, such as many a sentimental stringer together of rhymes has\nnever experienced. Evarne, care for me a little; love me, darling. Let\nme love you. It means everything to me.\"\n\nAll this sentiment quite overcame his sweet-natured listener. Morris had\nmade a studied though carefully veiled appeal, either by his looks or\nhis words, direct to her most generous instincts. If much of it was mere\nacting--exaggerated and artificial--his passionate desire to gain her\nlove was real enough. It was no reproach to frank, unsuspicious,\ninexperienced Evarne--already blinded by affection--that she could see\nonly the evident sincerity that inspired all this bombast.\n\nA flood of tender pity and sympathy swelled in her breast; all\nresentment at his deception, all hesitation and restraint, were swept\naway. If the assurance of her deep love, her utter trust, did in very\ntruth mean happiness to him, it should be his. Rising to her feet\nimpulsively, she pressed his head with almost fierce force against her\nbosom, murmuring, \"I do love you, my dear one. Indeed, I do love you.\"\nThen she bent over, and almost reverently pressed a long kiss upon his\nbrow.\n\nSo far, so good, and in mutual love confessed Evarne's ideal was\nattained! It was rather incomprehensible that she could for one minute\nhave supposed that \"finis\" would be written in Morris's masculine\nconception of the old, old story, at a similar point to where it\nappeared in the poetical version that had been evolved from out her\nimagination. Yet when, in the course of a very short time, the\ninevitable discovery was made that he had never entertained the notion\nof loving her as an \"inspiration to a noble life,\" nor as a \"kindred\nsoul,\" nor as his \"good angel,\" but merely as a man always loves a\nwoman, and that he sought a return of affection in kind, it came as a\nstunning revelation.\n\nAt first Morris had not been at all sure but that she would endeavour to\nshake the dust of \"Mon Bijou\" from her feet without delay. In fact, he\nalways declared that, probably inspired by the vicinity of Capri, she\nhad given him to understand that he was on a moral level with the\ndefunct Tiberius. But for her own part her first recollections that were\nat all clear and distinct were very different.\n\nIn all moments of mental disturbance her first desire was for solitude,\nand in this crisis, bidding Morris not to follow her, she sped wildly\nout into the dark garden. There, leaning for support against the pillar\nof a statue, and gazing up at the serene masses of white clouds and the\ntinted halo encircling the moon, breathing in the perfume of the earth\nand its green growth, while a gentle breath of sea-breezes played with\nher heavy hair, she gradually regained calmness.\n\nHer Greek studies had taught her much--so much that she had believed\nthere was but little left for her to learn. Yet to us all is life an\nuntold tale--strange, unique, unguessed. What wisdom of sage, what\nsensual raptures of pagan poet, had ever prompted her to anticipate the\nexaltation, the triumph, that awoke at the realisation that she too had\nher share in the resistless power of womanhood? She felt plunged into\nfull harmony with nature--felt herself knit to the great heart of woman\nall the world over by the sentient cords of sex-sympathy.\n\nCarried out of herself she flung back her head and gave utterance to\nemotion by lifting up her voice in song--just full rich notes that\nrolled forth unconsidered, all unhampered by words--a spontaneous\noutpouring of glorification and the joy of victory. Pressing both hands\nhard upon her bosom she felt the force with which it rose and fell\nbeneath her deep breathing, and strangely delighted, the girl laughed\ntriumphantly with the notes of her song.\n\nA sudden step near by startled her into abrupt shamefaced silence:\nMorris stood by her side. He had been seeking her in the garden and had\ntraced her by this wild song that broke the stillness of the night.\nUnrestricted displays of feeling were entirely new to Evarne, her\nprevious uneventful routine having given scant cause for much excitement\nof any sort. Now she felt keen abashment at her extraordinary show of\nemotion, and was almost humiliated to realise that she was not alone.\n\n\"I told you not to follow me. I don't want you,\" she said quickly and\ndecidedly.\n\nFor a moment Morris was startled; then he understood the change that was\nbeginning to take place in her mind. No longer was she a simple child\naddressing her guardian and benefactor, but a woman growing conscious of\nher own power. Of course she would be whimsical, capricious, alternately\nauthoritative and submissive, wilful and yielding, like the rest of the\ndarlings.\n\n\"I meant to obey,\" he answered with ready meekness, \"but can you blame\nthe impotence of mortal man's resolution when the siren calls?\"\n\nSudden anger flashed over Evarne at this vague suggestion that she had\nfled from him only to draw him to her side again by her voice.\n\n\"I'm not a siren, and I don't say one thing and mean another, though I\nknow you find it difficult to believe that of any woman,\" she replied\ncurtly, and with head erect walked back through the French window into\nthe brightly-lit room. Once safely out of sight, she darted rapidly\nupstairs to the safety of her own room.\n\nIn a minute or two she heard her name called softly through the door,\nthen the pleading whisper--\n\n\"Evarne, I can have no rest unless I know you are not angry with me.\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment, but the delay was brief. No resentment\ncould endure before the music of that dear voice. She guessed right well\nthat a locked door between them was all-sufficient for Morris to endure,\nso answered him generously, as her heart prompted--\n\n\"Rest, then; rest happily now and ever.\"\n\nWithin the peaceful sanctuary of her delicate green and white bedroom,\nthe chief amid her more normal thoughts and feelings resumed their sway.\nForemost came that imperative demand for self-approbation--that pride in\nself--that made her ever the slave of what she held to be honourable.\nThe spirit of righteousness sprang up alert, quick to wage war against\nthe mere suggestion that under any provocation--any excuse of\noverwhelming stress of love--she should permit herself to be stained by\ndishonour.\n\nStrong and self-confident, the girl at last sank to sleep. But her\nslumber was light, and early next morning she was awake and thoughtful.\nShe acknowledged being glad to have experienced the sensations of last\nnight--glad to have been granted that period of exaltation, and to have\nrevelled in it to the full. It had made all life seem more\nunderstandable and interesting--yet it had brought about no wondrous\nchange of personality! Evarne still remained herself; still good and\nconscientious and new to the ways of love; a young philosopher, and\ntherefore indulgent to the natural frailties of mankind. She esteemed\nMorris not one whit the less for having shown himself but human;\nyet--realising that he could not make her his wife--her conscience and\nher wishes united in the resolution that love 'twixt him and herself\nmust ever remain a thing ethereal--a poem--a fair dream--a sweet\nsentiment blossoming only in the soul.\n\nShe went to Florelli's as usual, but her studies occupied a very\nsecondary place in her thoughts. All she meant to say to Morris--all he\nmight perhaps answer--all the beautiful sentiments she had to express\nand which she was sure must appeal so irresistibly to him--all the lofty\nideals of her soul that she was going to impart to his--obtruded\nthemselves between her mind and her drawing.\n\nAs she dressed for dinner that evening an unexpected shyness crept over\nher, and it was with quite an effort that she went downstairs. But all\nimagined difficulties and embarrassments faded like snow before the\nsunlight of his eyes. Her own danced for joy at being in his presence\nagain, yet there was a touch of stiffness and formality in her demeanour\nthat was new.\n\nMorris listened more or less patiently to her dear little sermons, and\nwith difficulty resisted stopping her pretty lips with kisses. But she\nwas very much on her dignity that night, so assuring her that she was\nnothing more than a sweet, refreshing baby, he merely delivered a sermon\non his own account, with a very different text.\n\nThat night the influence of the day's high meditation rendered her proof\nagainst his sophistries, but as time passed their steady reiteration\nbegan to make headway. Morris unswervingly bent all his powers to gain\ncontrol of the situation. The sport amused him. He had nothing to\ndistract his attention, and the prize was so well worth the winning that\ntime and trouble were as nothing. He attempted no sudden decisive\n_coup_, feeling greater confidence in the weapons of gentle argument and\npersuasion, patience and a discreet mingling of ardour and forbearance.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER VI\n\n                            A SOUL'S BATTLE\n\n\nEvarne grew steadily more troubled--more unhappy--more shaken in her\nonce firm convictions. Up to the present, save in a few unconsidered\ntrifles, she had always obeyed the dictates of her conscience. Now this\nprop failed her; indeed, she seemed to have two opposing consciences,\neach struggling for supremacy.\n\nWhile one inward voice would desperately recall the existence of Mrs.\nKenyon, the other would reply by scornfully declaring that it was but\nselfishness, cowardice, calculating prudence and cold lack of trust,\nthat clutched hold of the vision of the distant invalid whose finger\nbore the only wedding ring that Morris could give, and that these\ncontemptible qualities used the wife but as a moral shield behind which\nto conceal their own mean, hideous forms. There was no breaking up of a\npreviously happy home involved, no ruthless destroying of another\nwoman's peace of mind; while beyond a doubt she was depriving the man\nshe professed to love--and to whom she owed everything--of the only\nreturn she could make for all his kindness and devoted affection.\n\nObviously this spiritual civil war could not forever consist of\ndrawn battles between the rival forces. Ere long even her own\nself-respect--the chief bulwark of the defending army--trembling beneath\nresistless attacks, was on the verge of capitulation. True, she might\nhave fled from \"Mon Bijou,\" but convinced of Morris's engrossing love,\nshe could not do this without likening herself to the snake of the\nfable, who, warmed back to life in its rescuer's bosom, then turned and\nstung him.\n\nBut unless she thus left Morris desolate, and cast herself helpless and\npenniless upon the world, she was forced to continue to accept\neverything--mere food and raiment, let alone luxury--at his hands, and\nabove all to receive daily and hourly that care and devotion that can\nonly be repaid in coin of the same nature. He so obviously delighted in\ngiving; was she, for her part, empty of all sense of gratitude, of all\ngenerosity?\n\nAlmost she began to deem herself something to be despised, and\nself-reproaches bordering upon remorse caused the bread of charity to\ntaste bitter in her mouth. At times every sentiment that is most\nennobling seemed ranged amongst the forces that bade her let love pay\nits debt. This veering of the tide of battle was not very visible, even\nto the man's watchful and experienced eye. His patience was getting\nexhausted. He had been fully prepared to wait, but with the passing of\ntime, the light in which Warren Hastings regarded the questionable\nacquirement of his much-discussed Indian fortune became applicable to\nMorris Kenyon's state of mind concerning his dealings with Evarne. He\nbegan to feel \"surprised at his own moderation.\"\n\nTherefore, on coming up quietly behind her one afternoon as she sat\nsketching in the garden, he overheard with some satisfaction the words\nshe was softly singing as she worked. It was the beginning of Emerson's\nlittle poem--\n\n    \"Give all to love;\n    Obey thy heart;\n    Friends, kindred, days,\n    Estate, good-fame,\n    Plans, credit, and the Muse,\n        Nothing refuse.\"\n\nWhen a fair maiden beguiles her solitude by dwelling tunefully upon such\nsentiments, it may reasonably be supposed that they are not altogether\nuncongenial to her mind.\n\nHe announced his presence by covering her eyes with his hands, and\nlightly dropping a kiss on the top of her head. When she had laughingly\nshaken herself free he lay down on the grass at her feet, and, plucking\na flower, commenced to pull it to pieces.\n\n\"You need not have sung that song to the birds,\" he declared, after a\nprotracted survey of her fair face. \"They need no such promptings,\nsweetest. They do obey their hearts.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is only meant for selfish human beings, then,\" she\nanswered somewhat plaintively. Then, moved to a sudden impatience at her\nburden of doubts, she threw her drawing-book on the ground, crying, \"But\nhow very futile to speak of birds. There is no comparison. What concern\nhave they with 'good-fame,' or with any other splendid responsibilities?\nWe human beings have got souls--or--or something of that sort, that we\nmust consider, haven't we?\"\n\n\"You think so!\" and the man's tone was mocking.\n\n\"And so do you,\" came the quick retort. \"You remember that picture we\nlooked at the other day? You yourself said it had no soul in it.\"\n\n\"That's altogether different. The sort of soul I meant is the gift of\nthe Muses. Come, my Greek girl, have you forgotten what you yourself\ntold me about your precious Socrates and his views on the necessity of\n'divine madness' in creative work? Now I, in my turn, assure you that\nthe brightest amid the Nine never bestows souls on those who refuse\nsubmission to Venus. Those who will not bend the knee at that shrine\nremain forever sane--but uninspired! You see, I know more of the\nclassics than you give me credit for.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe that I love you, that you tell me this? Oh, Morris,\nMorris dear, do understand!\"\n\n\"Little darling, it is you who do not understand. Your love for me is\nbut that of a sweet child; you know nothing yet of that irresistible\nforce that dominates the life of the world. The soul, as you like to\ncall it, that you already possess, is sleeping. It has slept long\nenough, Evarne; you must not be afraid of its awakening.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\n\"How little you know me, it seems. I could never care for you more than\nI do already. I'm sure--oh, you can't tell--but I'm sure I bear already\nthe very fullest extent of love that my nature is capable of ever\nproducing.\"\n\n\"Your believing that only proves the finite capacities of the powers of\nimagination! You see, you cannot even realise that there may be--and I\nassure you there are--possibilities of emotion lying dormant within your\nmind more powerful than you can even conceive of at present. Only those\nwho can, and who will, shake themselves free from all hampering\nlimitations ever become truly great in any direction. It is quite\nuseless to hope that the 'divine madness' of the Muses may be given to\nyou, unless you are already possessed of courage to seize on true\nfreedom, for that is the only soil in which anything worth having can\never take root, thrive and grow.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" she murmured nervously, reluctant to\nbelieve.\n\n\"In refusing to accept the full companionship of the man who loves you,\nEvarne, and whom you love in return, you are simply enslaving your\nemotions, enchaining them, and hopelessly preventing their perfect\ndevelopment. The technique of your chosen Art you will doubtless gain by\ntime and perseverance, but you are scornfully neglecting to bring to\nfruition a far more subtle source of power--the rich ripeness of soul\nthat alone can appeal to humanity's soul--the flame that can set blazing\nthe fire that lies at the heart of the race of man.\"\n\nEvarne again parted her lips as if to speak, but without hesitation\nMorris went on with his homily.\n\n\"Whether you set forth to create pictures or books or music, you cannot\npossibly give more to the children of your brain than is to be found\nwithin your own innermost self. Only by having known the most intense,\nthe loftiest, the deepest, in the whole range of emotional experience\nwill you be enabled to put knowledge into your work, and without that,\nwhat worth has any work of Art? Believe me, ignorance cannot possibly\nring true--truth alone can live and enthral.\n\n\"Now, believe me or not, as you like, Evarne, but I assure you that\nbecause of all this, love is the one and only teacher that can really\nevolve a great artist. Forgive me for thus assailing you on all sides,\nmy sweet iceberg, but your happiness and success are very dear to me. I\nsimply cannot bear to see you thus blindly and ignorantly opposing the\nunfolding of the bright flower of your genius. As I started by saying,\nyour soul is still sleeping, and it will slumber on until you can become\nreconciled to letting love awaken it.\"\n\nA protracted silence followed these last words. Evarne continued to gaze\nat Morris with the rapt expression she always wore when he was pouring\nfresh thoughts into her mind. This suggestion of a triple alliance\nbetween illicit love, the possession of a soul, and success in Art,\npossessed all the charms and the startling qualities of novelty.\n\n\"You are trying to make me think selfishly,\" she murmured at last, \"but\nyou must never believe that my own progress is of more consequence to me\nthan----\" She looked at him in silence again, and her eyes and her\nthoughts grew full of tenderness. Clasping her hands together, she went\non, \"And oh! if it were, I'm sure, oh! so sure, that the love I feel for\nyou already is--is----\"\n\n\"It is not of the sort that counts.\"\n\n\"But Socrates says that pure love----\"\n\nMorris interrupted her. He felt that this troublesome antique\nphilosopher must be resolutely suppressed once and for all.\n\n\"I cannot claim as intimate an acquaintance with the opinions of that\ngentleman as you possess, little sage; nevertheless, I'll be bound that\nhe supports my opinion. I can't definitely remember, mark you; I am only\nsure on general principles that no one who taught your pretty,\nsentimental rubbish--forgive me, sweetheart--could have contrived to get\nhimself accepted for so long. You look--or rather we will seek\ntogether--and I'll warrant that I find and show you confirmation of my\nwords.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night Evarne retired considerably earlier than usual, but unable to\nsleep, and soon utterly weary of the darkness and her own tangled\nthoughts, she resolved to follow Morris's advice of the afternoon. She\nwould delve once more into that master-mind that they had both invoked\nas upholding their contrary ideals.\n\nFlashing on the light, she went into the red room, and returned with her\narms filled with the six big volumes of Plato. Tumbling them all on the\ntable by her side she slipped into bed again, and reclining comfortably\namid her soft, faintly-perfumed pillows, drew a volume at random from\nthe pile, then hesitated a moment before opening it.\n\nShe had perfect confidence that in these works of Plato no sentiments\nwould be found of the nature that Morris sought.\n\n\"My dear one is unwise, after holding up fame and success as a bribe, to\nsend me to read this--which is my Bible--and which teaches that\nhappiness lies only in the pursuit of wisdom, of virtue, of all that is\ngood,\" was her thought, as she lazily laid open the pages. Little did\nshe deem that her bewildering doubts and difficulties were at length to\nbe definitely solved.\n\nIt is hard to avoid the terrible belief that there exists a malign\nomnipotent Spirit at enmity with the race of man; an evil Power\nuntiringly concentrated on watching for and contriving opportunities to\nwork dire mischief--to create miseries of all kinds--to impose agony of\nmind and body upon all that has life. Not without some show of reason\nhave there ever been secret sects of devil-worshippers, who recognise\nthe existence of, and seek to propitiate, this force so hostile to\nhumanity, this merciless Something that works with superhuman ingenuity\nto aid and bring to fruition that which is of itself--evil--to conquer,\nto destroy, to render impotent all that which is of a contrary nature;\nor more terrible still, to bend such to its own purposes, employing all\nthat is best and noblest and sweetest in life and human nature as tools\nwherewith to work destruction.\n\nWithin a few minutes of opening the Oracle, Evarne was sitting erect,\nall her sleepy indifference and listlessness gone. Throughout all the\ntime of her mental stress she had not appealed to these familiar works.\nWhat more could a further study of Socrates do than intensify her desire\nto remain his faithful disciple? She had deemed it quite useless to look\nfor special guidance as to which of the two opposing courses open to her\nreally led to the acquisition of true wisdom, virtue, and spiritual\nbeauty. That she should now open directly at one of those strangely rare\ndefinite statements concerning right and wrong, was a coincidence so\nextraordinary that it is difficult to believe that a controlling\nintelligence had not arranged this apparent chance.\n\nShe re-read the sentence upon which her eye had fallen, vaguely\nwondering how she could ever have forgotten its doctrine. It was a\nportion of the \"Ph\u00e6drus,\" and referred to that eternal topic, love, or\nrather to a certain imitation of the glorious reality. This semblance\nwas characterised as \"being mingled with mortal prudence, and dispensing\nmortal and niggardly gifts,\" and its dire result was \"to generate in the\nsoul an illiberality which is praised by the multitude as virtue, but\nwhich will cause it to be tossed about the earth and beneath the earth\nfor nine thousand years, devoid of intelligence.\"\n\nNaturally, it was not a belief in the threatened aftermath of harbouring\nthis \"illiberality\" that appalled her. It was the sudden revelation that\nthe inspired Socrates--far from upholding and approving her present\ndiscreet line of conduct--would have condemned her for \"illiberality\npraised by the multitude as virtue,\" as unhesitatingly as she was now\nwilling to confess that she herself held it in contempt! After the first\nmoment's shock she found comfort in the reflection that the opinion at\nwhich she had arrived independently, albeit slowly and reluctantly,\nfound confirmation in the words of this great teacher.\n\nSomething outside herself now seemed to take possession of her body, and\nto control her deeds. Immediate action became imperative. Instinctively,\nalmost mechanically, she sprang out of bed, flung her white silk\ndressing-gown around her, and sped barefooted along the corridor and up\nthe little flight of stairs that led to Morris's rooms.\n\nThere was still a light showing under the door; quite steadfastly and\nwithout hesitation she turned the handle, and when it refused to yield\nshe rattled it violently. Hearing a quick step inside she felt the blood\nsurge to her head, but no suggestion of faltering or regret came to\ntrouble her finally settled conviction. This seemingly wild\nimpulse--being in reality the climax of long reflection--was far from\nbeing a transient ebullition of feeling. It was rooted in her will; and\nEvarne's will, once fairly turned in any direction, was impervious to\nconflicting influences.\n\nIn the unnaturally exalted state to which her highly-strung nervous\nsystem had now lifted her, it would have seemed a mere nothing to\nhave walked into an arena of wild beasts for the sake of the man\nshe loved--easy to have flung herself upon swords to give him\nhappiness--yea, she would unhesitatingly have followed him to hell\nitself had he beckoned. Are those amid mankind who never knew the\n\"madness\" of Eros to be pitied or envied?\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER VII\n\n                           ROSES AND RAPTURES\n\n\nIn a time of fair summer, amid varied scenes of beauty, the next phase\nof Evarne's life glided past--vivid, brilliantly happy--as devoid of\napprehension or sense of finality as is the dream of a lotus-eater. As\nthe spring advanced, and Naples became over-sultry for those reared in\nnorthern climes, Morris took her to cooler regions. Together they\nwandered through Switzerland and the Austrian Tyrol, and only with the\napproach of the winter season were they again in residence at \"Mon\nBijou.\"\n\nWith the ensuing spring, Morris's restless spirit once more asserted\nitself, and the summer saw them in London. There he held a social\nposition which led him into circles where no man can introduce a woman\nwho occupies the position Evarne now held. But he saw that plenty of\ndiversions and gaieties of one kind and another came her way. She was\nstill interested in her Art, and, happy in love given and returned, she\nwasted no sighs over those society gatherings from which she was forever\nstrictly tabooed.\n\nMorris studied appearances to the extent of paying an occasional brief\nvisit to Mrs. Kenyon at their country home; in the autumn, too, he\nsometimes left Evarne to her own devices in the flat wherein she was\nmistress, while he joined shooting parties at various country houses.\nBut at the first breath of winter he was quite ready to be coaxed back\nto the girl's little Paradise on earth, \"Mon Bijou.\"\n\nOn their settling down once more at Naples, she was again seen at\nFlorelli's, bent on making up for lost time. Her artistic studies had\nbeen of necessity but intermittent. In Morris she beheld her paramount\nduty; he had been as ardent and jealous as any young lover, lamenting\nand grudging every minute that Art took her from his service. He laughed\nat the persistence with which she continued to snatch stray hours for\ndrawing. Her future was his care now, he insisted. He hated to think of\nthose soft, brown eyes squandering their beams upon inanimate objects.\nWhy did she want to waste any of the precious hours of her glorious\nyouth shut up in a crowded, overheated studio, that stank of paint and\nturpentine and microbes and humanity?\n\nBut Evarne had not entirely abandoned the study of Philosophy for that\nof Love. She told him, with fascinating seriousness, that in order to\nmaintain the mental balance that was described as \"Happiness,\" it was\nnecessary to both cultivate and provide an outlet for the intellectual\nfaculties, as well as for those impulses that were revelling with such\njoyous abandon amid \"the roses and raptures of vice.\"\n\nThus she was sadly disappointed when, within a fortnight of settling\ndown once more seriously to work, Morris announced that he was going to\nParis for a week or two, and of course expected her to accompany him.\n\nShe had just arrived at one of those stages, so delightful to pass\nthrough in any study, when a distinct advance in power is felt. The\nclose of each day's efforts left her with the exhilarating feeling of\nhaving surpassed herself--of having successfully overstepped her\nprevious highest limit. To abandon her work at this crisis was the last\nthing she desired.\n\n\"Morris, dearest,\" she pouted in sudden protest, \"why do we wander about\nso very much? It is so delightful here.\"\n\n\"But I must go to Paris now. I have business.\"\n\n\"I thought you never had to do anything you didn't want to? Anyway,\ndearie, couldn't you live without me for a fortnight? I know how it will\nbe! If you have got me with you we shall end up by roaming all through\nthe winter, but if I am here at 'Mon Bijou,' waiting for you--why, then,\nyou will return quickly.\"\n\nMorris protested, but in the end Evarne for once took her own way. It\nwas quite unusual for her not immediately and unhesitatingly to set\naside her own wishes should they chance to conflict with those of her\nlover; on the other hand, Morris always duly consulted her respecting\nthe plans and arrangements of their mutual life, and had never realised\nhow entirely it was his will alone that controlled their movements. Now\nhis vanity was wounded--not so much that she should question his\narrangements, as that the form the opposition took should actually imply\nher willingness to bear a separation. It was something fresh and strange\nin his wide experience, and--to his way of thinking--far from\nflattering! What he always expected was the necessity of soothing\njealous fears and apprehensions arising from periods of absence of his\nown making.\n\nThus he went off with a feeling of displeasure against Evarne that was\nnew. He did not comprehend that it was the very knowledge of the\nstrength of her own affection that enabled her to see him leave the arc\nof her personal magnetism and influence without feeling any anxiety. In\nLondon she had been forced to spend days alone while he was in the\ncompany of others--women, high-born, beautiful, no doubt--yet she had\nnever feared for his loyalty. Sweet, blind trust!\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nShortly after his return from Paris, Morris showed that he had no\nintention of spending the whole of the winter and spring at Naples, as\nhe had done during the two previous years.\n\n\"I've got a bright idea,\" he announced one evening. \"Let us spend the\nwinter in Egypt, voyaging up the Nile with a party of our gayest,\njolliest pals. What say you, Evarne? I know of a dahabeah, built for\nprivate use, that has lost its income, I suppose, for now it's willing\nto let itself out on hire. I wrote concerning it, and here's the answer,\ntogether with any number of photographs, both of its personal appearance\nand its internal regions.\"\n\nHe passed over a pile of papers, which the girl studied with keen\ninterest. Morris, Naples and the studio was a triple combination that it\nhad seemed impossible to improve upon; nevertheless, Morris, Egypt and a\ngay, bright party formed a decidedly alluring prospect if an alternate\nprogramme for the winter months was not to be avoided.\n\n\"Now, whom would you like to invite? We must resign ourselves beforehand\nto the idea that it will probably be the grand finale of our\nacquaintance with all whom we honour by our choice. The best of friends\ninvariably quarrel on long voyages.\"\n\n\"You and I will set them such an example that concord and harmony will\nreign supreme, won't we? _Absit omen._\"\n\n\"I really think we may defy Fate on that point, little sweetheart. Now,\nto business! We can have eight besides our charming selves. Let's ask\nthe Varesios--see what they gain by being able to speak English. Then\nthere are those rowdy Philmers from London--that's four. Then\nGiuseppe--he'll keep us lively too; he's like a jolly English boy, isn't\nhe? Not too overwhelmingly polite. Then there's Tom Talling--we must\nhave some more women, mustn't we?\"\n\n\"I think equal numbers are best.\"\n\n\"Oh, wise young judge! Well, look here, we can transport Talling to\nheaven as well as Egypt if we like to give him permission to invite that\nlittle French girl he's so mad over--Justine Feronnier, she's called.\nShe's a quiet, demure little minx, with curious, flaxen hair. She looks\ndown the side of her nose all the time, as if she had just come out of a\nconvent school. I'm sure you can't dislike her, and I should be glad to\ndo Tom a good turn. Do you mind?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. Who else?\"\n\n\"Um-m-m, who? Good gracious, I was forgetting Tony Belmont.\"\n\n\"The man you were with so much in Paris last month?\"\n\n\"That's it. He must come, and we will tell him to bring Lucinda.\"\n\n\"Is Lucinda another little minx, like Tom's friend?\"\n\n\"Well, she chooses to describe herself as Mrs. Belmont, and it wouldn't\nbe kind to show undue curiosity concerning the date and place of the\nwedding ceremony. We've settled upon one too many, haven't we? But\nGuiseppe is well accustomed to being tucked in as a sort of makeweight,\nso I declare this parliament prorogued.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what is the dahabeah called?\"\n\n\"'The Waterfowl' at present, but that's only fit for a houseboat on the\nThames. I shall rechristen her 'Evarne the Beautiful,'\" and Morris\nsmiled indulgently.\n\nBut the girl shook her head, declaring with a touch of coquettish\nself-confidence that she could not consent to such a name being chosen.\nOne Evarne the Beautiful was quite enough to occupy all his thoughts.\n\n\"Then, Lady Vanity, you must exercise your own ingenuity,\" he answered,\nand after a moment's solemn hesitation over the rival merits of \"The\nRiver Queen\" and \"The Radiant Isis,\" Evarne decided on the latter name\nas more appropriate to a craft destined to breast the waters of Old\nNile.\n\nEach desired guest accepted the invitation with flattering alacrity, and\nere long \"The Radiant Isis\" was fairly off upon her voyage up the great\nriver of the land of the Pharaohs.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER VIII\n\n                            LUCINDA BELMONT\n\n\nAll the guests were quite well known to their young hostess with the\nexception of Mdlle. Feronnier and Tony and Lucinda Belmont. As Morris\nhad said, there was little, so far as the average observer could\ndiscern, either to like or to dislike in the quiet, flaxen-haired,\nlittle French girl. Lucinda Belmont, on the contrary, possessed a\ndistinct and striking personality. Erect in carriage, and bearing\nherself with an air of unassailable self-confidence--with a full bust,\nand a waist so disproportionately tiny that Evarne surveyed it with\nmingled scorn and wonder--she was unmistakably what is popularly meant\nby \"a fine woman.\" Her big eyes, fringed by long, black lashes, were the\ntiniest bit protruding, whereby they were enabled to roll up and down\nand round about in wondrous glances, languishing or flashing, according\nto the requirements of the occasion. Her features were ordinary, yet her\nvivacity, her animation, together with her carefully chosen costumes,\nher elaborate coiffure, and the brilliance given by a most discreet and\neffective use of paint and powder, transformed her into a woman who\nexcited appreciative attention from most men.\n\nDespite her now considerable store of worldly wisdom, Evarne had not\ngot rid of a somewhat unwise confidence in humanity. Tennyson tells\nhow Vivian was able to see evil of one sort or another in the most\nnoble of characters through the simple method of \"imputing her own\nvileness\" to the thoughts, the deeds, the motives of others. In the\nsame manner did Evarne instinctively credit everyone with her own\nloyalty and honour. Assuredly Justine Feronnier and Lucinda were both\nunusually striking representatives of the female sex as far as\nappearance went. But the French girl was understood to belong to Tom\nTalling, and Lucinda--politely described as Mrs. Belmont--had the\nlegitimate owner of that surname in attendance upon her, so Evarne\nexperienced no unpleasant anxiety in beholding the attractive flaxen\ndemureness of the one, or the flashing brunette brilliance of the other.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe long days devoted to the uneventful journey of \"The Radiant Isis\"\nthrough the flat reaches of the lower Nile were relieved from monotony\nby the spirit of mirth that possessed all aboard. Morris had indeed\nchosen his companions with discrimination, if frivolity and constant\nlaughter were what he sought.\n\nOf course each individual was provided with that hallmark of the\ntraveller in the East, a hand-camera, and the results of the snap-shots\nof these amateur photographers caused many a shriek of laughter. Morris,\nGuiseppe and Signor Varesio had all brought their foils. But neither\nItalian had much chance against Morris, who was quite a champion in this\nart, to which he owed much of that slim, youthful-looking figure that\nwas his pride. Then there were games, dances, visits from Arab\nentertainers, fantasias by the crew--all serving to make time pass\ndelightfully.\n\nYet, slowly but surely, unhappiness crept in. The whole trouble had root\nin the resolute transference of Tony Belmont's ardent attentions from\nLucinda to the altogether unappreciative Evarne. She found him always by\nher side, even when it must have been obvious to the meanest\nintelligence that she and Morris were more than contented alone. At\nfirst she bore his society with outward patience, but soon there came an\nirritated dislike to this destroyer of so many pleasant _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates_\nbetween herself and the man who still ruled her entire heart.\n\nBesides, there was the deserted, disconsolate, sulky Lucinda to worry\nabout, and since neither Evarne's snubs nor hints, or even actual\ncommands, could drive Tony back to his neglected privileges, it became\nobviously Morris's duty as host to do his best to prevent the forsaken\none from feeling too overwhelmingly lonely. So it came gradually to\npass, to Evarne's dismay, that Morris spent most of his time by Mrs.\nBelmont.\n\nThe girl felt herself so helpless; in the privacy of their cabin Morris\nalways answered her loving complaints so gently and affectionately,\ndeploring the fact but insisting on its necessity and its temporary\nnature, that she sought at first to be trustful and comforted. But the\ntime came when she could no longer refuse to see that her lover was, in\nsooth, fully satisfied with the present state of affairs, and desired no\nother.\n\nThen the days grew full of anguish to the girl. Justine alone noticed\naught amiss, and showed a desire to advise as how best to cope with the\nsituation. But Evarne could not bring herself to actually acknowledge\nthat here she was suddenly plunged into a vulgar struggle with another\nwoman--and one so coarse, ignorant and inferior to herself--for the\npossession of a man.\n\nInstead, all that her youthful wisdom prompted was to strive to arouse\njealous doubts and fears in Morris's breast. So, for a weary, dreary day\nor two she was bewilderingly responsive to Tony's dull talk and banal\nand often over-bold compliments. But all she gained, as her laugh rang\nout gay and bright enough to rivet attention, was an indulgent smile\nfrom Morris, and the irritating remark from Lucinda--\n\n\"How splendidly you two do get on together! And I'll warrant all your\nlittle jokes are secret, so that Mr. Kenyon and I must be resigned to be\nleft out in the cold.\"\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IX\n\n                    HOW EGYPT WAS RUINED FOR EVARNE\n\n\nAt length the dahabeah drew up by the wharf of Luxor. From the beginning\nof the cruise the arrival at this world-famed spot had been eagerly\nanticipated, and on the very first morning the travellers gaily mounted\ndonkeys and set forth on the short journey to the ruined Temples of\nKarnak. The spirited animals that they rode--so very different from the\npoor little European drudges that go by the same name--covered the\nground with celerity, the dusky donkey-boys running hard behind, keeping\nup with difficulty, yet shouting and flourishing their sticks, to urge\non any of the fiery mounts that showed signs of a failing lack of\nambition to be foremost in the race.\n\nOn arriving at Karnak, loud was the expression of amazement at the\nextent of country over which was spread the ruins of this vast\ncollection of temples, with their halls, their courts, their huge\nentrances, their obelisks, columns and statues.\n\n\"I believe really it would be quite possible that one should lose one's\nself hopelessly amid all these ruins,\" declared little Justine, her pale\nface still flushed from the fun of the amusing gallop.\n\nThe only dismal countenance in the party was that of Hassan, their\ndragoman. This gorgeous and most self-satisfied personage was always\nrather inclined to sulk when expeditions were in progress. He then\nlooked upon his lot as that of a much injured individual. Morris knew\nEgypt well, and his interesting talks on the topic had made the old\nhistory and religion intensely attractive to Evarne before and during\nthe voyage. He now very rightly considered himself a far more\ninteresting cicerone than the verbosely ignorant Arab. He therefore\nrestricted Hassan to the mere business details, while he himself\nundertook the task of conducting his guests, of enlightening their\nignorance and training their taste.\n\nAs time passed and the day grew in heat, luncheon became the next item\non the programme, and at this point Hassan, coming into a portion of his\nkingdom again, brightened perceptibly. He carefully spread out the\ndainty meal in the shadow cast by a great wall, whereon sculptured\npictorial records of the war-triumphs of a Pharaoh dead for thousands of\nyears still preserved his royal memory green to posterity. Then, seating\nthe company, the dragoman waited upon them with satisfied importance.\n\nAfter all had recruited their strength for the afternoon's further\nexploration, Morris suggested that they should mount the sandy <DW72> and\nstone steps that led to the summit of the pylon--the great gate that\nformed the entrance to the whole of the ruins. The view thus obtained\nwas wonderful, he assured them; the sun was not too hot to defy the\nshelter provided by veils and parasols, while any cool breezes that\nmight chance to be wandering around would be more easily found at a\nheight. Thus encouraged, everyone started with such energy up the long,\nsevere <DW72>, that within a very few minutes a halt had to be called,\nwhile all stood and panted breathlessly.\n\n\"More haste, less speed,\" declared Morris. \"Now, Mrs. Belmont, you and I\nwill play tortoise to their hare, and we will just see who gets to the\ntop first.\" And, proffering his arm as a support to Lucinda, he\nencouraged her to persevere.\n\nTony, who had been sitting cross-legged on the sand, sprang to his feet,\nand with a sweeping bow offered Evarne a similar attention. She accepted\nit with a smile, and in due course the summit was attained.\n\nCertainly it was worth the trouble. In the background, against\nthe vividly blue sweep of lofty skies, appeared the sharp and\nclearly-defined outline of the arid, rose-tinted hills, concealed amid\nwhose rocky recesses lay the tombs of the Pharaohs of bygone days. In\nthe mid-distance the wide Nile--here dignified and placid, untroubled by\ndams, reservoirs or cataracts--flowed calmly and gently, cool even to\nbehold.\n\nBetween the water and the temple the eye roved over pastures, carefully\ncultivated, often of a most vivid emerald, broken by clusters of lofty,\nfeathery palm-trees. In the fields and on the pale dusty roads were\nArabs, their many-hued garments adding to the rich brightness of the\nscene, yet without rendering it at all _voyante_. Over all was the\nglamour of a dancing haze of golden sunlight.\n\nNear to the pylon, the Old and the New appeared in close conjunction. To\nthe left lay a temple, ruinous yet still massive, and another pylon, far\nolder than the Christian religion, but still almost uninjured by its\nvast weight of years. Nearer still stretched a wide avenue bordered on\neither hand by rows of huge ram-headed sphinxes.\n\nTo the right of these great works of times long past, lay a tiny\npoverty-stricken Arab village. It stood in the midst of a thin grove of\npalms, and was then encircled by an irregular wall of mud bricks. The\nsmall houses, also of dried mud, had, for the most part, been erected by\ntheir provident builders around the trunks of palm-trees, which helped\nsupport the huts, and gave some degree of shelter from the fiery rays of\nthe broiling summer sun. The flat roofs were covered with piles of\nsugar-cane, amid which played naked brown babies and small ragged\nchildren. The terrifying half-savage dogs that defended the village and\nall its belongings during the hours of night, now basked peacefully in\nthe mid-day warmth, or strolled around the top of the encircling wall.\n\nThe summit of the pylon itself, though fairly wide, was rough and steep.\nIts height was great, and the extensive view accentuated the feeling of\nloftiness. But Evarne's few years of \"softness\" and luxury had not\nsufficed to entirely undo the effects of her early training. The\nsensation of height had small effect upon her well-trained nerves, and\nwhen she wished to gaze particularly into one special little courtyard\nwithin the village, she walked boldly to the farther end and edge of the\npylon.\n\nAs the party had neared the top their ears had been greeted by the sound\nof numerous voices uplifted in unison; on gaining this point of vantage\nthe source of these cries could be seen.\n\nEvidently death had visited the village that day, for the courtyard of\none of the largest of the small houses was filled with women wailing and\nlamenting, while little knots of females were approaching with all speed\nfrom the entire countryside. Clad in their shapeless and voluminous\nblack robes, with trailing ends leaving clouds of dust in their wake,\ntheir heads veiled, their faces hidden in the yashmak, they formed a\nstrange, weird spectacle as they advanced, all uttering concerted cries\nof mourning that grew louder as they neared the village in which the\ndead man lay. The European witnesses of this phase of native life were\nconvinced that only the departure to another world of one of the male\nhalf of humanity would have sufficed to create such a stir in the\nsurrounding district.\n\nA band of mourners reached their goal. Their arrival was the signal for\nthe already assembled women of the village to wax yet more demonstrative\nin their display of anguish. The long shuddering moans, the shrill\npiercing cries, grew louder and more insistent, while dozens of lean\nbrown arms were raised in despairing appeal to heaven, then descended\nwith force upon head or face, and others of the mourners tore\nfrantically at the garments over their breasts.\n\n\"It's just as it is drawn on the ancient monuments, the very same; they\nhaven't changed a bit in all these thousands of years,\" cried Evarne.\nShe was far more thrilled by this illustration of the realism of\nEgyptian art and of this justification for that romantic term--The\nUnchanging East--than moved to sorrow by the conventional mourning of\nthe many wailers.\n\nEvidently the news had spread widely. From all directions black figures\nbore down upon the village, sometimes in groups of six or eight,\nsometimes in bodies of thirty or more. Each one on her arrival passed\ninto the low hut wherein the corpse lay, then came out after a minute or\nso to add her quota to the increasing lamentation for the dead. This\nbusiness of mourning was clearly still the prerogative of the female\nsex. No men took any share in it--indeed, the only two existing in the\nwhole place, as far as could be seen, were squatting calmly in a\nneighbouring yard, unconcernedly holding and milking a buffalo.\n\nEvarne looked round for Morris. He stood just at the top of the <DW72>,\nLucinda still clinging to his arm.\n\n\"Come along to where I am, Morris,\" the girl called out to him. \"You can\nsee everything much better from here.\"\n\nHe made a movement as if to follow her suggestion, but Lucinda said\nsomething in a low voice, whereupon he replied--\n\n\"Mrs. Belmont feels too giddy either to walk or to be left alone; but\ndon't you bother about us, my dear. We can really witness all the fun of\nthe fair quite nicely.\"\n\n\"That chap may have died of fever or smallpox, or goodness knows what,\"\nremarked Tony's voice by her ear. \"With all these women trotting in to\nhave a last stare at the old boy--why, it's enough to infect the\nneighbourhood, isn't it?\"\n\nTo Evarne the Jealous the health of the whole countryside was as nothing\nat that moment compared to the fact that when she had directly called\nupon her lover to join her, Lucinda should have had the assurance to\npromptly whisper a suggestion that he should remain where he was, and\nthat the wish of her rival should have sufficed to keep Morris from her\nside.\n\nShe turned to Tony.\n\n\"Take my smelling-salts over to Mrs. Belmont,\" she said, opening her\nhand-bag and producing the little crystal bottle with its jewelled\nstopper. \"Stay by her and look after her if she feels bad, won't you, so\nthat Mr. Kenyon may come here where it is easier to see?\"\n\nBut a different remedy for overcoming the lady's attack of nausea had\nalready been prescribed. Supported by Morris's arm she had commenced to\ndescend from the height.\n\nEvarne instinctively uttered a little exclamation.\n\n\"Let 'em go,\" suggested Tony. \"We don't want to go down yet, do we, Miss\nStornway?\"\n\nEvarne glanced around at the remainder of her companions. Tom and\nJustine were seated close together on a stone by her side, apparently as\nrooted to the spot as ever Theseus and Pitheous could have been; the\nothers were grouped near at hand, all staring downwards with the keenest\ninterest.\n\nEvarne was obliged to agree. Nature had been very neglectful in not\nimbuing her with the art of scheming and contriving events to suit her\nown purposes. True, she had now a daily object-lesson in the manoeuvres\nof the adept Lucinda, and without being conscious thereof, her education\nin this direction was in progress. However, she was still in the very\nearly stages, and could devise no method on the spur of the moment for\npreventing this hateful division of the party.\n\nShe shook her head and pursed up her mouth discontentedly.\n\n\"It's very evident that no one else wishes to descend yet awhile,\" she\nacknowledged. \"Just ask Mr. Kenyon, then, where we shall find him when\nwe do return to earth.\"\n\nTony left her side, and as rapidly came back.\n\n\"It's arranged that we are to have tea at four o'clock on the same spot\nwhere we lunched. Kenyon says let's meet there at that hour, and all\nwander about anywhere we choose for the rest of the afternoon. If\nthere's anything particular we want to see again, Hassan knows the way\nabout. That's all right, isn't it?\"\n\nShe nodded, but dared not trust herself to speak.\n\n\"Aren't we tired of this diversion?\" cried Guiseppe, joining them a\ncouple of minutes later, his bright spirit having no inclination to\ndwell long on aught connected with death.\n\n\"The others are not, but that is no reason why you should remain,\" she\nanswered rather eagerly. \"Anyone who does not want another hour at least\nup here is to go with Mr. Kenyon. Hurry up!\"\n\nShe experienced a certain malicious delight in the idea that she had\nthus counteracted Lucinda's trick, but her self-congratulation was but\nshort-lived. Guiseppe promptly returned to her side.\n\n\"Kenyon says Mrs. Belmont's head is too bad to stand my noisy chatter,\"\nhe explained. \"Noisy chatter, d'you hear, Tony, old boy? My noisy\nchatter, forsooth! That to me, the most timid, retiring violet of the\nwhole lot of you,\" and he set to work to prove his words by causing the\nvery echoes to ring with his clear musical laughter.\n\nEvarne clenched her hands, and a ferment of emotions tore her breast. Of\ncourse she had known all along that Morris was perfectly capable of\nprocuring _solitude \u00e0 deux_ in the face of any difficulties if such were\nhis wish. Now this proved it! It was his will, not his ingenuity, that\nhad failed, when subduing Tony's attentions to herself had been the\nproblem.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER X\n\n                          THE SHRINE OF SEKHET\n\n\nAt the hour appointed for tea they all headed their course towards the\nsite chosen for meals, and there, already seated on the rugs,\ncomfortably leaning against the wall, were Lucinda and her escort.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" shouted Guiseppe. \"You don't know what we've just\nbeen learning, ignorant ones that you are. The columns in the great hall\nare three thousand five hundred feet high, and----\"\n\n\"No, no! three thousand five hundred years old,\" he was corrected.\n\n\"Oh, I retire crushed.\"\n\n\"You need a cup of tea to revive your failing mental powers. So do we\nall.\" And ere long the spirit-stove boiled away merrily and the general\ndesire was gratified.\n\n\"You have indeed missed an interesting sight this afternoon,\" declared\nSignora Varesio.\n\n\"My unfortunate giddiness!\" sighed Lucinda plaintively.\n\n\"What have you seen to compensate for it?\"\n\n\"Oh, we have been over to a little temple--most interesting. But I was\nfated to receive shocks this afternoon. In it there is----\"\n\n\"Don't tell,\" interposed Morris. \"After tea we will take them all over\nand let them make the discovery for themselves. It will delight you,\nEvarne, I'm certain.\"\n\nAs he spoke he looked across at the girl with that tender smile that\nalways penetrated to her very heart. It could do much even now to heal\nthat dull ache that would make itself felt despite her belief in his\nrepeated assurances of the fixity of his affection towards her sweet\nself, and her consequent faith that the affair with Lucinda was a mere\ntemporary flirtation. She tried hard to be reasonable, and so long as\nshe could think that Morris's earnest and serious love was still hers,\nand that the attraction any other woman might have for him was merely\ntemporary, she felt that--although a degree of anxiety and apprehension\nwas inevitable--she ought to be able to look down from the superior\nheights of constancy and make allowances for that dancing butterfly--a\nman's fancy.\n\nStill, this course of diplomacy--laid down by that most successful of\nroyal mistresses, Madame de Pompadour--is difficult and painful indeed\nwhen the heart-happiness of the resident on the superior heights depends\nwholly upon the vagaries of the butterfly. Moreover, Evarne's poor\nlittle vanity was receiving a series of severe blows. For so long she\nhad been accustomed to being first and foremost in Morris's regard--to\nseeing the society of all other women set aside, if at all possible, for\nher own. Now, despite her combination of trust and philosophy, this new\nstate of affairs was a protracted anguish. She was resolutely brave\nunder it--perhaps too much so to be quite pleasing or flattering to\nMorris. Even the deep-rooted hatred she bore Lucinda was almost entirely\nhidden.\n\nWhen the slight meal was ended and the moment came for once more setting\nforth, Mrs. Belmont arose with a childishly pretty air of happy\nimportance. \"Now I must be dragoman,\" she declared, and proceeded to\nlead the way amid the ruined masses of stone and fallen columns. But she\nwas soon fain to confess that she could not remember the track, and\ncalled upon Morris for aid.\n\nSmiling, he took the lead. Poor Evarne! Life seemed to have become a\nseries of heart-squeezings. Her keen eye noted the smile that was\nflashed upon Lucinda, and it appeared to her to be every whit as\nindulgent and kindly--almost as caressing--as that which had hitherto\nbeen reserved for herself alone.\n\nIt was necessary to cover quite a long distance over a plain besprinkled\nnot only with fallen stones, but with a long spiky growth that rendered\nprogress difficult.\n\n\"It is well worth this walk,\" declared Morris, joining her after a\nwhile, \"for what we are going to see is the most perfectly-preserved\ntemple in the whole of Karnak. It is very small, but one gets from it a\nbetter idea of what these buildings must have looked like in their palmy\ndays than the larger ruins can show.\"\n\n\"Talking about 'perfectly preserved,' why didn't the old 'Gyps pickle\ntheir 'corpsies' instead of bothering to stuff them?\" demanded Tony.\n\n\"Don't be nasty,\" retorted Evarne curtly; and a few minutes later the\ngoal was reached.\n\n\"Now, go in one by one,\" suggested Morris, \"and ladies, be prepared for\na shock.\"\n\nDespite this warning, Evarne could hardly suppress a little cry as she,\nin her turn, entered alone into the inner sanctuary of the tiny temple.\nIts walls were completely decorated with richly  representations\nof weird deities and worshipping mortals. There was no window, but the\nrays of the sinking sun filtered in through a small opening in the roof.\nThe chamber was dim and gloomy, but the one square beam of light was\narranged to fall with concentrated force upon a solitary upstanding\nstatue in polished black basalt. It depicted a slender woman's form,\nsurmounted by a cat's head. So perfect was it in every detail, so\nrealistic, so full of quiet animation, that for a moment Evarne had\nbelieved herself to be in the presence of something living and dreadful.\n\nAlmost immediately, of course, she realised her mistake, and knew it for\nwhat it was--a representation of the ancient Egyptian goddess Sekhet.\nAlready that day the girl had stood in the middle of an open field--once\nthe site of a great temple, of which the ruins lay all about--and gazed\naround the extensive circle of large, gleaming, black marble statues of\nSekhet that now alone remained to hint at the departed grandeur of this\nvanished temple.\n\nEvarne's brown eyes had grown graver, and all-unconsciously she had\nsighed deeply as she stood amidst those numerous Sekhets seated beneath\nthe clear blue sky. They had struck strange awe to her heart, these\nsymbolic counterfeits of the goddess who presided over the most\npowerful--the most eternal--forces in heaven and earth, Sekhet--goddess\nboth of Love and of Cruelty! Ah, they were a subtle people, those\nancient Egyptians, skilful in reading the heart of humanity, fearless of\nthe truth, defiant in stripping the gloss from life!\n\nThe light laughter and exclamations of her companions had jarred upon\nEvarne's ear. She felt weighed down with an unreasoning reverence.\nThese solemn figures in the great ruined hall of the temple had\nseemed instinct with a supernatural power. Battered by the passing of\nmuch time, discredited for centuries as representing a great\ndivinity--objects but of curiosity and wonder to this age--they had yet\nappealed to her as invested with the calm complacency of conscious\npower. Serenely they sat, confidently awaiting at least the individual\nrecognition and homage of mankind. Strangely did they convey the idea\nthat theirs was the triumphant knowledge that, for so long as human\nhearts can pulsate, for so long, too, Sekhet--the personification of\nLove and Lust, and the suffering both bring--shall find her throne, her\nshrine, her arena.\n\nThis figure that Evarne now stood before was not seated. Somewhat over\nlife-size it stood, stiffly erect, one foot advanced, the symbol of Life\nheld in its grasp. It was raised above the sand of the floor on a low\npedestal. Evarne stood motionless, gazing upwards. The battered figures\nin the open had been impressive, but this one--uninjured, and with the\nartificial advantage of its surroundings--was more than that! It was\nterrible, awe-inspiring, with its inhuman head, the menacing feline\nfeatures bearing so clearly the impress of unpitying and vindictive\ncruelty, malignant spite, merciless joy in the inflicting and witnessing\nof the direst agonies that can rack tortured brain or flesh or spirit.\n\nEvarne had been the last to enter, and as she rejoined her companions\noutside, the party commenced to retrace its steps. Unperceived, she left\nthem and returned to the temple. She had something to say to Sekhet.\n\nAlone she stood, facing the goddess--the lifeless marble into which the\nhand of an artist, long since pulseless, had wrought this unhallowed\nexpression with such marvellous realism that it was difficult to\nremember that no knowledge, no power, no fearsome intelligence, lay\nbehind those gleaming eyes, that low animal brow. Evarne stood\nmotionless, gazing intently up at the brutal face, trying to forget her\nown individuality and all that was modern. It had been a little prayer\nthat was in her heart as she hastened back, but now she shook her head\nslowly as the conception of the innate and unalterable cruelty of Sekhet\nimpressed itself with yet greater force upon her mind. This was a\ngoddess who surely had ever been more inclined to fulfil curses than to\nanswer prayers.\n\nAs she commenced her half-whispered appeal she recalled some of the\ntitles under which this cat-headed image had been invoked--doubtless\nmany a time and oft--in the dim and distant past. \"Oh, Queen of the\nGoddesses! Oh, Crusher of Hearts! If you can hear me and still wield\npower, let just tribulation fall on all those who set forth to steal a\nlove that is not free for them--a love to which they have no right--a\nlove that is another's! May success but open the gates of sorrow; may\nthat which they desired and schemed to gain crush the heart, even in its\ntriumph, down to the very dust! Deal out stern justice, untempered by\nall mercy, to the false, the scornful, the treacherous, the\nhypocritical, to those who are unscrupulous and base in thy service, and\nwho cast aside all honour when in pursuit of that which thou dost\noffer!\"\n\nThen she stood silent awhile, still gazing with fixed eyes at the\nimpassive countenance before her, monstrous, yet so strangely human. She\nhad not originally designed to send forth such a plea into the universe,\nbut it had arisen spontaneously from the depth of her soul, and she\nwould not have recalled one word.\n\nThen she turned, and slowly, with strange reluctance proceeded to quit\nthis dim sanctuary. Still her mind was not relieved. Impulsively she\nhastened back and stood close under the grim black statue.\n\n\"Sekhet,\" she whispered softly and rapidly, \"help me--help me always.\nWhatever be the price of your aid I will pay it ungrudgingly. Watch over\nme; be ever near me. I cannot live without love. I do not shrink from\nits suffering. Sekhet, at all costs, I am thy worshipper. Do not forsake\nme. Do not forsake me ever.\"\n\nAt the throat of her gown were fastened a couple of crimson roses. They\ndrooped now after the long day, yet were still rich in perfume. These\nshe unclasped and laid on the yellow sand at the base of the statue.\nThen, with a final glance around the little chamber--once well\naccustomed to the sound of prayer, now but the relic of a dead\nreligion--she hurried away.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XI\n\n                            A LOSING STRIFE\n\n\nEvarne radiated with delight and relief when this Nile cruise came to an\nend. She could not avoid the mortifying conviction that she had proved\nherself very childish and incompetent in having allowed a state of\naffairs so painful--let alone dangerous to herself and her future--to\nhave come to pass, and to continue. Lucinda, ignorant as a kitten on\nEgyptology and all kindred subjects, had been wont to wax enthusiastic\nover what she appeared to consider Evarne's quite superhuman fund of\nknowledge and marvellous intelligence, as contrasted with her own\nmuch-lamented but unconquerable silliness. Yet the girl guessed shrewdly\nthat had the situations been reversed, the frivolous, empty-headed\nLucinda, so given to harping on the topic of her own incompetence, would\nhave proved an infinitely more resourceful and successful tactician.\n\nDelightful indeed was it to see the last of the Belmonts--both so\nobjectionable in their respective ways--and when she found herself once\nagain alone with Morris at \"Mon Bijou,\" she was gay and light-hearted as\nany child in her renewed happiness. Florelli's studio saw her not. She\ndevoted her whole time to Morris, as bright, appreciative and amusing a\nlittle comrade as man could wish.\n\nBut, alack and alas! this sojourn in the oasis of contentment was\ndestined to be but brief. One morning, not long after their return, as\nthey sat at breakfast on the verandah, Bianca entered with the post. No\nletters ever came for Evarne save bills, which she always passed\nstraight over to Morris; but this time her name appeared on the face of\na delicate pink envelope. On the back were the initials \"L. B.,\"\nintertwined into a large and involved gold monogram.\n\nThe whole thing was highly perfumed, and its recipient sniffed with\nexaggerated disdain even before she had opened the envelope and mastered\nits contents. When she had done that she looked up in genuine\nindignation as she murmured, \"The impertinence of the woman!\"\n\nMorris, who had been watching her, now reached over for the letter, and\nlikewise perused the \"impertinence.\" It apparently did not strike him in\nthe same light, for, as he laid it down, a meditative grunt of approval\naccompanied the action.\n\n\"I think we will accept,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh no, no--impossible!\" was Evarne's instantaneous and startled\nresponse.\n\nThe letter that had created such emphatic difference of opinion ran as\nfollows:--\n\n    \"DEAREST EVARNE (for so I always think of you),--Absence makes\n    the heart grow fonder, so they say, and I find it true that it\n    wasn't until the radiant time on 'The Radiant Isis' was over\n    that I realised how very attached I'd become to you, dear. I do\n    hope we shall mature our friendship begun under such delightful\n    auspices, so I am writing to ask you if you will become my guest\n    in Paris for some weeks. Do come, dear; I am so looking forward\n    to seeing you again.\n\n    \"I'm well aware when I ask this that Mr. Kenyon is the fair\n    Evarne's devoted shadow, and I mustn't dare to enjoy the sweet\n    charm of the rose without its accompanying thorn (of course that\n    is quite between ourselves, dear); but Tony is writing to him,\n    for he has promised (dear fellow!) to take Mr. Kenyon off on\n    long masculine jaunts (and we won't inquire too deeply where\n    they go, will we, dear?) while you and I are enjoying the Paris\n    shops and other feminine frivolities in one another's society to\n    our heart's content.\n\n    \"I am looking forward to a most enjoyable time, darling Evarne.\n\n                       \"Your affectionate friend,\n                                                   \"LUCINDA BELMONT.\n\n    \"P.S.--We shall be both getting our new season's 'rigs-out,'\n    shan't we? I know of such a heavenly place for hats.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed, I don't want to go! I should hate it. I can't bear either\nMr. or Mrs. Belmont,\" cried Evarne, after a silence long enough to show\nonly too plainly that Morris was not going to readily yield to her\ndesires in the matter.\n\nOn the contrary, he proceeded to argue. At her age she ought not to seek\nto bury herself in the solitude of studios or a villa remote from the\ncentres of civilisation. She owed it to herself to be seen and admired.\nShe must go more amongst people, and the companionship of a\ngood-natured, clever woman of the world--such as was Mrs. Belmont--would\nbe of vast benefit to her in every way.\n\nThe girl retorted that she had no objection to the centres of\ncivilisation as such, nor to meeting as many of Morris's friends as he\nwished, but that she would not visit Mrs. Belmont, with whom she had not\na taste or a thought in common; who was, in fact, a person entirely and\nabsolutely hateful in her eyes.\n\nHer voice quite quivered with apprehensive distress, but when Morris\nproceeded to speak on Lucinda's behalf, lauding her tact and worldly\nknowledge, Evarne rose in indignant wrath.\n\nIf those were the qualities that were characteristic of Mrs. Belmont,\nthen, for her part, she hoped never to become tainted by their\npossession. \"But,\" she declared, \"without being either as tactful, or as\nwise, or as experienced as that middle-aged designing creature, I'm not\nquite the abject fool she seems to take me for. She need not think that\nher sickening show of affection towards me has ever deceived me one jot.\nI put up with it and her in Egypt because I couldn't help myself, but\nI'm not going to her house, and you can write and tell her so, for I\nshan't even answer her hateful, hypocritical letter; so there!\"\n\nHaving delivered herself of this ultimatum, she flung her serviette on\nthe table and swept away, heedlessly dragging over her chair with the\ntrain of her morning gown. Morris gazed in amazement at her empty place.\n\nIt was the first serious clash of wills that had ever risen between the\ngirl and her lover. The dispute was ardent and protracted, but very soon\nit became evident that both her coaxing and her resolutions were equally\nvain when opposed to his wishes. While ostentatiously leaving her\nperfect freedom of choice for herself, he was going to Paris!\n\nSo, with the utmost reluctance and a considerable sense of humiliation,\nEvarne submitted as gracefully as might be. She could not bring herself\nto so far cherish her dignity as to remain haughtily alone at \"Mon\nBijou,\" knowing Morris to be once more within the range of the wiles and\nallurements of a clever and unscrupulous _demi-mondaine_. Although she\nbelieved that, up to the present, she still retained her sway upon his\naffections, his own teachings led her not to place too confiding a\nreliance upon the Joseph-like qualities of the most devoted of lovers.\n\nNever before had she bade adieu to her beautiful brilliant room with\nsuch a heavy heart. She stood in the doorway, gazing longingly around,\nimprinting every corner, every contrast of colour, freshly upon her\nmemory. How happy she had been at \"Mon Bijou\"! How dear it all was to\nher!\n\nBoth common-sense and diplomacy prompted her to greet Lucinda with\nsmiling, albeit somewhat stiff, cordiality, and she effectively\nconcealed her scorn when her hostess, gushingly embracing her, put her\nface close up to hers and made a hasty little smacking sound into the\nair, first on one side, then on the other--Lucinda's only conception of\nhow to kiss another woman.\n\nMorris had given Evarne a cheque-book, and opened a generous account for\nher at his bank, and for the first few days the programme promised in\nthe invitation was carried out to the letter. He and Tony did, in fact,\nderive whatever satisfaction and benefit was to be gained from one\nanother's society, while their female belongings amused themselves\ntogether by shopping and such-like diversions. The girl could not but\nacknowledge that Lucinda's vivacity and bright flow of talk were far\nfrom unamusing, yet to recognise the efficiency of the weapons of one\nwhom she felt to be her remorseless foe did not at all ease her mind or\nsoften her reciprocal feelings of enmity.\n\nVery soon the foreseen change came to pass.\n\n\"It's absolutely stupid to have nice men on hand if one is to see\nnothing of them. One might just as well be a miserable Egyptian woman\nright away,\" announced Lucinda, and none could contradict her words.\n\"It's too mean of me to bore dear Evarne by keeping her all to my dull\nself,\" was her next statement. And so the divided expeditions of the\nparty ceased, and then it was not long ere the old miserable state of\naffairs that had ruined the cruise of \"The Radiant Isis\" was again in\nfull swing.\n\nBut even this was not enough. Next came the suggestion that\n_t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ expeditions were, after all, better. Lucinda was sure\nthat, as Evarne was so clever, and an artist too, she, of course, must\nwant to go round the galleries and see the statues and such-like things.\nLucinda herself was so very silly she couldn't appreciate old masters\none bit. Then she got such dreadful headaches in the close atmosphere.\nIt must be lovely to be strong just like a man, as dear Evarne was, but\nfor her part she got utterly exhausted in half an hour. Really, she must\nreluctantly relinquish these delightful expeditions to dear Tony. Tony\nhad quite gone off his head lately; he had actually taken to trying to\nimprove his mind. She couldn't imagine why! As if dear Tony wasn't quite\nclever enough as it was for a silly, frivolous little woman like\nherself, who only cared for chiffons. Perhaps it was the beneficial\nresult of Evarne's society on board \"The Radiant Isis.\" She only wished\nshe was half as clever as dear Evarne; cultivated women acquired such a\ngood influence over men--so much more powerful and lasting than silly,\nfrivolous creatures like herself could ever hope to gain.\n\nEvarne hated her! Hated her for her gibes, her scarce-concealed mockery,\nand, above all, she loathed her for the sarcastic flattery and\nnever-failing show of affection under which thin veil she sought to\ncover her intention of stealing the girl's rich lover, if she could\nencompass that act. It was a method that made retort difficult; and,\nmoreover, Evarne was under the disadvantage of still retaining her\nover-sensitive self-respect. It was revolting to her to openly admit\nthat she was engaged in a vulgar struggle with another woman--and a\nwoman so far beneath herself--for the possession of a man.\n\nNow she said simply and frankly that her interest in museums had always\ndepended entirely upon Morris's society, and that without him such\nthings did not appeal to her much. But, far from pleased by this\nstatement, he frowned darkly, spoke of neglected opportunities, and\ndiscourtesy to her host. Finally he acknowledged that--relying upon her\nbeing otherwise pleasantly occupied--he had arranged to take Mrs.\nBelmont for some expeditions in a certain swift motor-car that only\naccommodated two. Thus, short of creating a scene, the girl found\nherself faced by the alternatives of remaining alone in the flat,\nobviously sulking, or endeavouring to cover her defeat by accepting\nTony's eager escort and pretending to enjoy visiting the antiquities and\nart treasures in the Louvre.\n\nShe had already implored Morris to leave Paris, but he had turned a deaf\near to her appeal. Now, although she managed to smile at Tony and to\ndeclare, gaily enough, her willingness to further encourage him in\nimproving his mind together with her own, she was torn by agony of\nspirit at this new proof of her beloved's rapidly maturing infatuation\nfor her rival.\n\nNevertheless, it all had the advantage of preventing the final blow from\nfalling as a bolt from the blue. Nor was the hour far off.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XII\n\n                       SEKHET, CRUSHER OF HEARTS\n\n\nOne morning, weary and depressed after a wakeful night, her\ndetermination had faltered at the very moment of setting out on an\nexpedition with Tony as sole escort. With her foot actually on the step\nof the carriage she had suddenly informed him, somewhat curtly, that he\nreally must amuse himself that day, returning and shutting herself in\nher room, deaf to all expostulations.\n\nTony, decidedly chagrined, had loitered for a while in the lonely\nflat--teased the dog--flirted with one of the maid-servants--and had\nfinally taken his departure.\n\nEvarne sat on in solitude, alternately striving to read a novel and\nfreely permitting her tortured imagination to dwell on the vision of\nMorris and Lucinda being whirled happily together through the fresh\ncountry lanes.\n\nA few hours later, hearing a footstep and the sound of the opening front\ndoor, and wishing now to make peace with Tony before the others returned\nand troubled her with \"whys\" and \"wherefores,\" she went to the\ndrawing-room, prepared to be very sweet and amiable. But the footsteps\nhad not been those of her host. It was the motoring couple who had\nreturned thus early.\n\nLucinda, vivacious as usual, had already removed her hat and veil, and\nwas drawing off her long gloves. She worked industriously at the fingers\nof one hand until she had drawn a loose end of the white kid forward\nover each finger-tip then suddenly called upon Morris.\n\n\"I'm impatient. I can't tear these things off. You had better come to\nthe rescue.\"\n\nGathering up the already loose ends between his thumb and finger, Morris\ntook hold of her other hand also, and suddenly jerked both her arms\nforcibly over his shoulders. As she unavoidably fell forward on his\nbreast he encircled her waist and kissed the laughing face so near to\nhis own.\n\n\"There's none like you, you damned little witch,\" he declared.\n\nEvarne had not desired to be an eavesdropper, and had no thought of\nconcealing her presence now. She still held in her hand the book she had\nbeen reading, and, with a sharp indrawing of her breath, announced her\npresence by violently flinging the volume to the ground with a loud\nbang.\n\nSeeing her, Lucinda uttered a scream and fled. Morris remained without\nmoving, gazing at the girl with the utmost nonchalance.\n\n\"You've precipitated matters, Evarne,\" he said calmly.\n\nHer first outburst of anger was directed against Lucinda.\n\n\"There's nothing in all this world that is more utterly despicable and\nhateful and detestable, more altogether vile, than to pretend a\nfriendship for a woman in order to get chances to steal her lover!\" she\ncried, with sufficient energy to suggest that she was directing her\nopinion through the closed door that Lucinda had banged after her in her\nhurried flight.\n\n\"All's fair in love and war,\" retorted Morris.\n\n\"That's a lie,\" was the startlingly frank answer.\n\n\"Is it? Then what about you and Tony?\"\n\n\"Tony Belmont? Be careful, Morris! What about us? That creature, seeing\nsomething more to her taste in you, has flung her cast-off lover at my\nhead. He has played into her hands readily enough, and you have stood by\nand seen it being done. How dare you then ask such a question?\"\n\n\"Well, you may choose to look at it in that light, but the fact remains\nunaltered and undeniable that Tony practically deserted Lucinda from the\ntime he first saw you, and you didn't care one jot what suffering it\ncaused that poor little woman.\"\n\n\"Poor defenceless little darling!\"\n\nThe words were spoken with bitter sarcasm, while the fiery indignation\nalready surging within the girl's breast increased tenfold beneath this\namazing accusation--this unscrupulous falsifying of the truth. There was\na moment's silence, then her words rang out with passionate force--\n\n\"Oh, the arch hypocrisy! Liars, both of you--abject liars--trying to\nmake excuses for your own foul treachery! It's sickening! I shan't stay\nanother night--no, not another hour--beneath her roof.\"\n\n\"It is Tony's roof, and you had better remain.\"\n\n\"I won't, I won't! How can you even suggest such a thing? I can't\nbreathe the same air that she does. It's poisonous--contaminated!\"\n\n\"Gently, gently; you'll be overheard.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! I don't care! I won't be gentle. What do you mean by defending\nher? What is she to you?\"\n\nAnd the verbal refusal to be gentle was confirmed by a violent blow on\nthe table.\n\nMorris, albeit decidedly surprised, answered with unruffled suavity. He\nwas quite willing to make allowances for this natural anger and show of\nindignation; at the same time the wondrous patience the girl had\nexhibited hitherto had given him little cause to anticipate the\ntempestuous quality of her aroused wrath.\n\n\"Is your philosophy all culled from antique authors, sweet student? Have\nyou never found time to peep into Darwin and assimilate the doctrine of\nthe Survival of the Fittest?\"\n\n\"What's that to do----?\" she cried in bewilderment, not seeing at first\nany connection between her question and this answer. Yet even as she\nspoke came a sudden mental illumination of his meaning.\n\n\"Morris, you can't mean to say you really do prefer that vulgar,\ncoarse-minded, spiteful, abandoned creature to--to----Oh Heaven!\"\n\nShe brushed her hair roughly back from her forehead, and stared at him\nfixedly, her big eyes still full of incredulity. Then she uttered a\nbrief laugh of mingled bitterness and disdain.\n\n\"But there! From a man's point of view, I suppose the Fittest always and\nonly implies the Newest. Despicable wretches, the whole lot of you.\"\n\nMorris, amused at this sweeping statement, smiled as he answered--\n\n\"But it's a little weakness that is no ways confined to mere man. It\nisn't only to us that constancy spells boredom. It's all very well for\nmiddle-aged women, who feel their power of pleasing on the wane, to\ncling like limpets. We expect it, and it's one reason why wise men avoid\n'em. It always means beastly rows in the long run. But, thank goodness,\nat your time of life, my child, variety is charming, even to the fair\nsex.\"\n\nThe latter portion of these sentiments fell unheeded--practically\nunheard. All the girl's thoughts and senses were concentrated upon her\nown agony of spirit. Fully grasping now, for the very first time, that\nMorris's defection was serious and deliberate, all indignation and\nresentment were swamped by a wave of wild grief and horror before which\nall else broke down. When she could speak it was only in disjointed\nsentences, in a voice that quivered under stress of emotion and\nstruggled with choking sobs.\n\n\"Oh, oh! Can I only bore you now by loving you? You can't mean that. Not\nreally and truly. I can't have lost your love so utterly. What have I\never done? Oh, Morris, what have I done? I've never altered to you, and\nI never would. I would always be faithful to you--always. Is it a curse\nto have a faithful heart? I can't stop caring for you, because you tell\nme to; how--how can I? Are you really altogether tired of me? I knew men\ndid get tired, easily, cruelly easily, but somehow----Perhaps if I'd\nbeen different? Oh, I did try! I did, always! I did! But there, I've\nbeen so utterly miserable lately, it's better really to know the truth\nstraight out at once. Tell me the truth, Morris.\"\n\n\"But you know it, my dear.\"\n\n\"Tell me, tell me!\"\n\n\"Now what is the good of upsetting yourself like this? Come, come!\"\n\n\"You're going to give that--that woman--my place! Oh! you'll be sorry.\nShe's only selfish and mercenary. She doesn't love you, and I do.\nYou--you don't care for that, though. Oh, how can you?\"\n\nMorris was feeling awkwardly uncomfortable. He took a flower from a\nvase, and put it in his buttonhole before he spoke.\n\n\"I'm perfectly aware,\" he confessed at length, \"that in the abstract\nLucinda is neither so handsome, so brilliant, nor so really delightful\nas you are, but still--still----\" He paused. \"There, I'm not worth\nbothering about, so dry your eyes.\"\n\nBy a powerful effort of self-command she managed to regain some degree\nof composure, and to steady her voice. Quite quietly she repeated his\nwords, \"not worth bothering about,\" then, after an interval, \"Ah, me!\"\n\nThe tender yearning tone in which this little exclamation came was\nfraught with significance. After another moment's thought she approached\nquite close to him, and rested the tips of her fingers upon his chest.\n\n\"I'm afraid you _are_ worth bothering about, my dear,\" she went on,\nmaking a rather pitiful little attempt to hide her sick anxiety by\npretending to smile. Then, after a somewhat protracted pause, she spoke\nagain.\n\n\"I--I--there, why should I be ashamed to say it again, even now? I love\nyou still--oh, so much! I'm sure I shall always love you. I can't help\nit. We can't arrange our feelings so that they shall always be\nconvenient and suitable. It was never really right that we should care\nfor one another at all, because--because of your wife, and I would\nnever--no never--have taken her place if you had even so much as hinted\nthat you might one day come to look upon it as something merely\ntemporary; something that could be lightly set aside as soon as you met\nanother woman whom you--liked a bit.\n\n\"No, don't speak, Morris! I haven't done yet. You know full well that\nthough I loved you, oh! so dearly, I never wanted to lead any other than\nwhat I thought was a perfectly honourable life. You know you didn't win\nme easily, in spite of everything being in your favour. You told me that\nbecause you had made a mistake in your marriage you were lonely and\nunhappy, and that, though you couldn't make me really your wife, our\nunion should be as lasting and sacred as any legal bond. It was to be\nyour true marriage. You're not treating me fairly now, dear, you're not\nreally. You ought to feel really more tied to me by honour and loyalty\nthan you would do even if I were indeed your wife, and had not lost my\ngood name for your sake. I've never been troublesome and jealous, you\ncan't say that, and when you found you were getting--well, seriously\nattached to another woman, it's not a bit unreasonable of me to think\nyou ought to have avoided seeing her again. You owed it to me to be true\nalways--you did, indeed. You knew I was not like Mrs. Belmont, who\ntreats these ties so lightly. Come away now, darling--come away from\nParis. She can't really have won your heart yet--only your fancy, only\nyour passing fancy, Morris. You would soon forget her. Come away with\nme, and we will be so happy together again, and honest and upright and\nwithout any cause to be ashamed, either of us. Do come, darling--do,\ndo.\"\n\nHer arms were tightly clasped around his neck, and her wistful, eager\nface--the piteous brown eyes moist and beseeching--were close to his.\nBut beauty that has palled no longer possesses power. Sentimental\nappeals to honour and loyalty were very troublesome; while the reference\nto an imaginary link that was to be held binding upon him for evermore\nwas merely vexing.\n\n\"You're a good, sweet little soul,\" he said, rather testily, unclasping\nher arms--\"no one knows that better than I do--and I should have\nsupposed, therefore, that you would be the last to suggest that we\nshould continue our life together without mutual love. On the contrary,\na woman of your moral excellence ought not to be willing to consent to\nsuch a proceeding. And, what's more, you mustn't blame me, you know.\nRemember your own wise words, 'We can't arrange our feelings, our\naffections, according to what would be, perhaps, the most conducive to a\nquiet life.' We may all be but the sport of the gods, but let's go on\nstrike against taking part in any tragedies for the entertainment of the\nhigher powers. Let's insist on being merely comedians. We will say\ngood-bye smilingly, and thus snap our fingers at Fate.\"\n\nEvarne twisted her hands together helplessly. She had much to say, so\nmuch, but further speech was beyond her power.\n\nHer throat swelled, she bit the inside of her lower lip pitilessly to\nstay its quivering, but was scarcely conscious of the tears that poured\ndown her cheeks unheeded. After a minute's futile struggle to retain\nsome show of self-command, she moved away a step or two, sank into an\narmchair, buried her face in the cushions, and sobbed without restraint.\n\nA tumultuous medley of wild impassioned ideas surged within her brain,\nincomplete thoughts, disconnected and rapidly cast aside. But, amid them\nall, were none urging calm submission, dignified resignation. On the\ncontrary, all alike were directed on evolving some method of warding off\nthis unendurable blow--or, at least, since it had fallen, of nullifying\nits effects.\n\nThe thing seemed so incredible, unreal, impossible, the end of all life.\nShe resolutely declined to admit that there was nothing whatsoever to be\ndone; she could not consent to allow all hope to leave her. And\nyet--yet--immovable and grim, the bedrock underlying these wild surgings\nof despised and deserted love, was the conviction that her richest store\nof eloquence, the whole of her most intense and protracted efforts,\nwould prove powerless to alter the inevitable. Distracted, tortured, she\ngasped between her sobs--\n\n\"I shall kill myself.\"\n\nMorris was just in the act of stealing softly from the room. Looking\nrather foolish, he turned sharply, and crossed over to her side.\n\n\"Tut, tut! You don't know what you're saying now, you're talking\nwildly,\" he declared soothingly. \"You really mustn't take things so to\nheart. You'll make yourself quite ill. Go and lie down quietly, and I'll\nsend Bianca in to you with a cup of tea.\"\n\n\"You think I don't know what I'm saying, but I know that I'm not saying\nhalf I feel,\" she declared truthfully enough. Then, after a moment's\nfurther reflection, her momentary composure again gave way. \"Oh, how\ncould you make me love you, only to treat me like this? It was cruel,\nbrutal! How can I bear it?\"\n\nMorris patted her shoulder encouragingly, but remained silent. He had\nbeen through a few tempestuous scenes ere this, and knowing that a man\ndid not shine on such occasions, was resigned to looking and feeling\nfoolish while it lasted, devoting his efforts chiefly to getting the\n_mauvais_ _quart d'heure_ over as quietly as possible. For this, his one\ntheory lay in the proverb, \"Least said, soonest mended.\"\n\nEvarne put out her hand and pushed him away.\n\n\"Don't do that--don't! You know you hate me now.\"\n\nAgain Morris smiled; women always went to such extremes.\n\n\"Bless you, not a bit of it! Why, I hope we are going to part the best\nof friends,\" was his lightly spoken disavowal of this accusation.\n\n\"To part!\" murmured Evarne, after him, monotonously--\"to part!\"\n\nThen suddenly an inward voice seemed to commence repeating over and over\nagain, \"There is nothing so dead as a dead love. There is nothing so\ndead as a dead love. Nothing so dead, nothing, nothing!\" It was\nmaddening. The unhesitating certainty--the calm conviction animating the\nphrase--brought final despair. In it she heard a call, inspired by the\nwisdom of ages, the outcome of the most bitter experience of long\ngenerations of mankind; a call to abandon efforts that were predestined\nto be sterile. It was as if she were abruptly faced by the inscription\nthat Dante read over the gateways of hell. Sitting erect, she lifted her\nvoice in lamentation.\n\n\"Oh, Morris, darling, you can't change so utterly. You're the same man.\nI'm still the same woman. How many times did you swear you would love me\nalways and ever--always and ever--and now I'm only just twenty!\" she\nwailed, catching at his arm and pressing her cheek to his coat-sleeve,\nwhile her sobs grew louder and more convulsive.\n\nMorris, already wearied, felt a tiny twinge of compunction, and was\nthereupon easily moved to anger by her impassioned weeping.\n\n\"For goodness' sake, Evarne, do let us have an end to this ridiculous\nscene,\" he said roughly, shaking himself free from her despairing hold.\n\"Do recognise the fact that not all the pleading in the world will have\nany effect on me. If you don't pull yourself together you'll have\nhysterics in a moment, and I've no patience with hysterical women.\"\n\nThe action, the cruel words themselves, and the tone in which they were\nuttered, combined to goad the girl to sudden wrath. She sprang to her\nfeet, and without a moment's hesitation frantically struck him on the\nchest with her clenched fist.\n\n\"Don't think I shall ask anything of you now--no, not so much as your\npatience,\" she cried. \"I don't intend to plead with any man for his\nlove, least of all with you--don't think it! I never want to see you\nagain, never! Go to Mrs. Belmont--go and make her your mistress.\"\n\nMorris allowed himself to be thoroughly angered by the blow.\n\n\"Thanks for the permission,\" he said curtly; \"but it happens to be quite\nunnecessary, as we have not waited for it.\"\n\nHe now anticipated being deluged beneath a torrent of words, but though\nher lips parted, Evarne stood quite speechless, only blinking her eyes a\nlittle, as if bewildered and dazed. Then she slowly retreated backwards\nacross the room step by step, until she was brought to a standstill by\nreaching the china cabinet. Leaning against it, she turned her head from\nside to side for a minute or two, then, producing a flimsy, ineffectual\nlittle handkerchief, proceeded, with strange, unlooked-for composure, to\nwipe her eyes and tear-stained cheeks.\n\n\"So now you see you may just as well be sensible and resigned, eh?\"\nsuggested Morris, with forced carelessness.\n\nEvarne made no sign of having heard, but continued her touching little\noccupation. The protracted silence became embarrassing. Morris was\nhaunted by the fear that this apparently delightful calm must be but\nominous and deceptive.\n\n\"I'll make different arrangements by to-morrow,\" he continued at length,\nin a business-like tone. \"I can understand you don't care to be in the\nsame place. I ought not to have allowed it. I apologise.\"\n\nStill silence. He was just about to speak again, when Evarne announced\nin tones of quiet conviction, seemingly to herself, \"I must get away\nfrom this house at once--at once!\" and walked towards the door as if\nabout to suit the action to the words without any delay.\n\nBut Morris hurried over to prevent the fulfilment of this impulse.\n\n\"Believe me,\" he assured her, retaining his grasp of the door-handle,\n\"there is some one who would rather that all the rest of us should slip\nover the fourth dimension than have you undertake the _r\u00f4le_ of\nvanishing lady. Darwin applies all round, remember, and to Tony's way of\nthinking you are the fittest in all the world.\"\n\nA dangerous gleam darted into the girl's eyes, and she stamped her foot\npassionately.\n\n\"How dare you offer me such an insult? Haven't you done enough yet to\nmake yourself hateful to me? Have you no shame whatsoever? Be silent, I\ntell you--be silent!\"\n\nHe made a gesture of despair.\n\n\"Of all the unreasonable people! Now, why should listening to a simple\nstatement of facts cause you to get into such a temper?\"\n\n\"Why?--why, indeed! You can't see; oh dear no, it's quite beyond your\ncomprehension, isn't it? Learn this, then: though you have made me a\nmore degraded creature than I ever before realised, you haven't killed\nall my soul, neither shall you.\"\n\n\"Souls at this moment! Good gracious, my dear girl, I only wish I had\nmade you a bit more practical. But there, I fear you're utterly\nincorrigible. Poor old Tony mayn't be quite your ideal knight, but do\ntry to realise that while sugar-icing forms a charming coating for a\ncake, the cake is just as sustaining without it. Are you positively so\nblinded by silly sentimentality as to be really incapable of seeing any\ncause for congratulation in the lucky chance that has led him to take a\nfancy to you? A good-hearted fellow with plenty of money. What more can\nyou want?\"\n\nAnger had found small place in the girl's breast while she was being\nmade to realise the dread truth that her lover was finally weary of her\nand of her affection; nor had even lasting indignation awoken until he\ntaunted her with the display of bitter grief that this very knowledge\nhad evoked. When he thus persisted in what she could but deem the last\nof insults--this determination to regard her only as a light toy, to be\ntossed from one man to another--then the capacity for wild wrath that\nshe derived from her violent low-born mother, and a long line of\nfiery-tempered maternal ancestors, showed itself in all its power.\n\nUp to the present her own personal gentleness of spirit, aided by the\ntrend of her education, and the affection by which she had always been\nencircled, had sufficed to keep even the girl herself in ignorance of\nthe capacity that lay dormant in her blood for feeling and displaying\nwild fury. Now, in circumstances provocative of wrath such as had never\nyet occurred in the whole range of her limited experience, she became\nentirely her mother's daughter.\n\n\"If ever again I touch a farthing of such money may I fall down dead!\"\nshe cried wildly. \"That's my only answer. Oh! It's the devil gives money\nto men of your stamp, so that you may with more certainty work out your\nown damnation.\"\n\n\"Do not be melodramatic,\" implored Morris, giving each word its full\nvalue to render it more impressive, while he shook his head, and screwed\nup his face in superior disdain. \"Of course----\"\n\n\"I don't want--I refuse, absolutely refuse to hear anything more you've\ngot to say; so you may as well hold your tongue,\" interrupted Evarne\nfiercely. \"Get out of the way; stand aside from the door; let me get out\nof this room.\"\n\nBut Morris did not move.\n\n\"Not so, you're far too excited. There's no knowing what you might do.\"\n\nHe made a great mistake in preventing her from finding the solitude she\ninstinctively sought. His words and presence were unendurably\nexasperating at this juncture.\n\nShe sat down on a couch, and tapped the floor impatiently with the toe\nof her velvet slipper.\n\nMorris tried again.\n\n\"If you could only persuade yourself to look at the matter clearly--\"\nBut he broke off abruptly. Evarne had merely raised her head and looked\nat him, but that was all-sufficient. \"It's evidently no use talking\nsense to anyone so beside herself as you are now,\" he concluded lamely.\n\n\"No use, so let me pass.\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet, and came close to him. Her face was flushed,\nwhile her eyes seemed to fairly blaze with passion; every breath she\ndrew was distinctly audible. It really spoke something for Morris's\nstrength of mind that he stood his ground.\n\n\"Not until you're calmer,\" he insisted.\n\nHer lips set themselves into a firm line, and for a moment she appeared\nto be contemplating the employment of physical force to gain her will,\nbut apparently she thought better of it, for, quite suddenly sweeping\nover to the opposite side of the room, she turned her back on Morris and\nleant both elbows on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"You know that Tony----\" he recommenced, somewhat unwisely; then changed\nhis sentence: \"If you would but believe that I am only considering your\nbest advantage----\"\n\n\"Believe you?--never again Liar! Abject liar!\"\n\nMorris was thoroughly aroused.\n\n\"Now, look here, what do you suppose it matters to me what you do now?\"\nhe demanded fiercely. \"I could more than discharge all my obligations to\nyou by a final cheque, and I don't want any further show of ingratitude\nif I give you also the benefit of my advice. I tell you, a young woman\nof your personal charms needs not only money but a protector. However,\nplease yourself.\"\n\nEvarne turned sharply, and again broke in upon him before the words were\nwell out of his mouth.\n\n\"Do you want to drive me mad?\" she shouted. \"I hate you, I loathe you, I\ndespise you! Oh, if some one would only protect me now from you, you\ncoward!\"\n\nThe veins stood up on the man's temples.\n\n\"It's difficult to see why you persist in going on like a fool, and\ntrying to deceive me. I'm perfectly convinced that, whatever the price\ndemanded you will no more be found living without luxuries in the future\nthan you have in the past, so why indulge in these absurd airs and\ngraces of outraged virtue?\"\n\nFor a moment everything whirled before Evarne's eyes; then, incapable of\nremaining without action, she commenced to pace up and down the room. A\nlittle table on which stood photograph frames, a vase of lilac, and\nvarious similar knick-knacks, stood in her path. Without a moment's\nhesitation she flung it aside, scattering the dainty ornaments in all\ndirections.\n\n\"It's foolish to be angry with you,\" said Morris, suddenly calming\nhimself. \"You are clearly not responsible for what you do or say. You\nmust go to your room and lie down. Do you hear? I insist. It would serve\nyou right if I did leave you to your own devices entirely, but you are\nso young and silly that for your father's sake I'm going to see your\nfuture settled somehow, whether you say 'thank you' or not. Now come.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare to touch me!\" screamed the girl. \"You've no right now to\ninterfere with my life, and you shan't do it. How dare you speak of my\nfather, when you've so brutally betrayed his trust? You've lied, and\ntricked, and ruined me. I suppose you can't help being so ignoble and\ncontemptible that loyalty and faith are only objects of derision to you;\nbut that you should be willing--anxious--to pass me on to a despicable\nrake--not so vile as yourself, but still vile--that I shall never forget\nand never forgive, and, if I can help it, God likewise shall never\nforgive.\"\n\n\"What a ridiculous position to take up! Do you really expect to be ever\nanything more than one upon a string of beads? You knew you hadn't been\notherwise with me, and you never will be now with any other man--so you\nmay as well make up your mind to it, and think yourself lucky if----\"\n\nThe girl, distracted and infuriated, waited for no more. Snatching up a\nsilver statuette she hurled it with all her force at her betrayer's\nhead. Then for a time she knew nothing; all was a blank--devoid of\nmemory--of thought--of consciousness of action. Quite suddenly she\nseemed to regain her senses--to awake to find herself alone--the carpet\ncovered with fragments of broken glass, streams of water, disordered\nflowers, books, scattered ornaments, while she herself was throwing\nmadly, fiercely, everything on which she could lay hands, smash against\nthe closed door by which Morris had been standing.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIII\n\n                         OUT OF THE GILDED CAGE\n\n\nInstantly subdued by amazement, she stared aghast at the surrounding\ndestruction. At the dread realisation that she was beholding the work of\nher own hands, a shrinking horror--a terrible fear of herself--filled\nher breast. Why, in very sooth, this looked like the doings of a\nmadwoman, and she had known nothing of what she was about. What could it\nportend? Trembling violently, she leant against the wall, scarcely able\nto stand, her hands pressing her cheeks, her eyes dilated and glancing\naround as if in apprehension.\n\nHow blessed just at that moment would have been the care of her\nmother--or, indeed, of any tender woman. But she was quite alone--or\nworse than that, surrounded only by those who had reduced her to this\nstate, and by servants filled with curiosity.\n\nAfter an interval of quietness the door was cautiously opened a trifle,\na head was popped in and rapidly withdrawn. Evarne had not time to\nnotice to whom it belonged, but she immediately regained sufficient\nstrength to walk across the room. She could not endure to be thus made\ninto a spectacle, neither could she longer gaze upon this dire material\ndestruction that typified, only too cruelly, the fate that had befallen\nher love, her happiness and her future.\n\nAs she opened the door and appeared on the threshold, there was a\ngeneral sense of rustling, of rapid footsteps, of stifled exclamations\nin the corridor and the surrounding rooms, as various figures hastened\nto efface themselves. But the girl, heeding nothing, made directly for\nher own apartment and securely locked herself therein.\n\nThen, after a moment's reflection on what had passed that hour, she\nagain collapsed beneath alternate transports of anger and heart-tearing\ngrief. Now she would be sweeping wildly to and fro, with clenched fists\nand hurried strides, her body swaying and shaking as she walked; next,\nexhausted, flinging herself upon bed or floor, torn with sobs, drowned\nby tears, only to spring to her feet again as stress of anguish goaded\nher to action.\n\nHer feelings towards Morris were variable as the wind. At times the\nmemory of his brutal insults, his treachery and faithlessness, were\nuppermost in her thoughts; then she felt for him only the most intense\nand passionate hatred, bitterly grudging every hour of happiness to\nwhich she had contributed in the past; praying wildly that the future\nmight hold for him agony of spirit equal to that into which he had so\nruthlessly plunged her. Then, again, a flood of her old devotion would\nrise above all else. \"Morris, Morris, come back to me! Oh, my darling,\nmy darling, how can I live without you?\" was her sobbing appeal; but\nthere was none to answer.\n\nFor the most part she sorrowed in silence. She was aware that whispered\nconversations were in progress outside her door, and more than once the\nhandle was turned cautiously. Later in the afternoon, Bianca, who was\ngenuinely attached to her beautiful young mistress, ventured to tap\nagain and again, at the same time imploring, in a tremulous voice, to be\nallowed to do something--anything. But Evarne turned a deaf ear to all.\n\nTime passed, and the first violence of her emotion burned itself out.\nThen she became conscious that she felt sick and ill, and that her head\nached to distraction. Letting down her thick black hair, she threw\nherself once again upon her tumbled bed, and made a first serious and\nprotracted effort to remain absolutely quiet and calm. Long she lay\nthere, staring at vacancy, sighing piteously at intervals, until as the\nevening twilight crept into the room, the lids drooped over the wild\neyes and the exhausted girl sank into slumber.\n\nWhen she awoke, it was night. The room was shrouded in darkness, and\nperfect silence reigned. As recollection returned she despairingly\npressed her hands to her head, but firmly forbade any further lapse from\nself-control. The determination she had arrived at during the weary time\nshe had lain passive before falling asleep was now to be put into\naction. When the traitors who were beneath that roof awoke in the\nmorning, they should find their victim gone. She shrank from again\nmeeting either of the Belmonts; Morris it was better she should not see.\nOne of the trains that left Paris in the grey of the morning should bear\nher away--far beyond the reach of these, her enemies.\n\nHer thoughts turned towards London. She was not exactly a feminine Dick\nWhittington; at the same time the great metropolis certainly seemed to\noffer the greatest hope for one who had her own way to make.\n\nFlashing on the light, she looked at her watch. It was a quarter-past\nthree. She rose up, and drawing the curtains over the windows, set about\npacking the few things it was imperative she should take. At first she\nseemed to possess neither bag nor box of a suitable size, and, gazing\nhelplessly around the room, realised how weak and nervous, and, above\nall, how curiously dull and stupid, she was feeling. With an impatient\neffort she pulled herself together, and concentrated all her wits upon\nthis question of a box. Finally, she thought of her dressing-bag. By\nremoving most of the fittings she was able to crush into it all she had\nsorted out to pack.\n\nThen, slipping off the embroidered muslin morning-gown she still wore,\nshe sought for her plainest and most serviceable outdoor costume.\nEvarne's taste in dress in no ways inclined to simplicity. She gloried\nin frills and furbelows, dainty details, falling lace and fashionably\ncut skirts. Even her tailor-built gowns were not really severe. The fact\nthat a brown face-cloth was made with a short skirt prompted her choice.\nIt was elaborately stitched and strapped, but demure in tone, its only\ncontrasting colour being a touch of delicate rose-pink--chosen by Morris\nhimself to match the exquisite tint of her cheeks.\n\nShe took no ornaments, but drew from a corner in her jewel-box a small\nenamel watch, the last gift of her father. With a stifled sigh she wound\nit up, and, shaking it a little to make it recommence its long-abandoned\nduties, pinned it on her dress, while she laid the yet tinier bejewelled\ntoy that had superseded it back into the case.\n\nShe would scornfully leave behind every ornament that had belonged to\nbrighter days; Morris would find them all and perhaps be a bit sorry!\nBut money she must have, and she looked anxiously into her purse. It\ncontained but a couple of napoleons and some silver. There were four\nmore gold pieces in her desk; her velvet bag with the turquoises\ncontained only two. The embroidered bag, bought to match her latest\ngreen costume, contributed three, while a few stray francs lay on the\ndressing-table. She gathered them all into her lap and counted them.\nOnly a little over twelve napoleons altogether. It was alarmingly\nlittle, but it would have to suffice. This done, she again studied the\nhour. It was not yet four. She had no idea when the earliest train set\nout, but felt convinced that it could not start so matutinally.\n\nIt was nearly sixteen hours since she had last tasted food, but she was\nnot at all conscious of hunger. She was in a strangely numbed state of\nmind. Beyond an impatience to be once fairly off, she seemed unable to\ncare for aught else. Nothing mattered! Nothing ever could matter now!\nStill, the sight of a plate of fruit reminded her of her long fast, and\nshe half-peeled a banana, but even as she raised it to her lips, a\nsudden repugnance at the idea of eating anything further beneath this\nroof, caused her to put it down untasted.\n\nReady even to her hat and gloves, she sank into an armchair to wait an\nhour or so before venturing forth. Not until she sat there, gazing with\nhalf-unseeing eyes around the delicate room, did she begin to grasp the\nfull significance of the complete change that had so suddenly taken\nplace in her circumstances.\n\nNot only was her path in life to lie apart from Morris Kenyon's for\nevermore, but she was abruptly and unexpectedly plunged into the direst\npoverty. She had no hope, even remotely, of a reconciliation with her\nonetime lover, but she felt curiously calm and indifferent now. Then,\nalthough she knew well enough that poverty, with all its shifts,\ndeprivations and unpleasantnesses would be hateful to her--she could not\nfeel really concerned at the prospect. Nothing mattered--nothing ever\ncould matter again! Everything was finished!\n\nShe was without the least idea of what she could possibly do to earn an\nhonest livelihood. As far as went that capacity, she was every whit as\nill-placed as when her father died. True, she had been studying art,\nmore or less seriously, for the last three years, but no one knew better\nthan herself how futile would be any attempt to earn money by this\nmeans.\n\nWhat then? The effort to think was painful. What had come over her?\nSomehow she seemed incapable of even remembering trades or professions,\nto see if she could not manage to fulfil the necessary qualifications.\n\nWhat did other young women do? Oh! of course, they were governesses, or\nchildren's nurses, or companions to invalids or old ladies, or--or--that\nsort of thing! But posts such as these surely required some capacity,\nand above all, a good reputation. She was, then, in truth, worse off\nthan when she had first left Heatherington with Morris, so confident, so\nfull of hopes for the future.\n\nWhat were girls allowed to do without their miserable past existences\nbeing scrutinised? How about telephone girls and those who served in\nshops of one sort and another, those who were attendants in restaurants?\nThose who--who--well! She couldn't think of anything else just then; but\nthere was clearly quite a choice of honest ways of grubbing up a\nlivelihood--if one must live at all! Without exception, all appeared\nabsolutely hateful. Viewed in anticipation, it seemed as if she might as\nwell be dead at once, as devote all the days of one week to earning just\nenough to keep herself alive the next week, so that she might work\nthrough that, in order to be able to live the next seven days, and so\non, and so on, with cheap clothes, poor food, scarce and low-class\ndiversions, until old age overtook her--and then--what?\n\nShe passed through a moment of positive fear and repulsion, and\ninstinctively her thoughts turned to Tony. After all, was she not\nrushing into a battle in which she must fall conquered. She could please\nmen--that she knew well--but could she do anything else in life? She was\nso accustomed to wealth and ease and comfort now. What could she do\nwithout it? Would the time ever come when she would despairingly view\nthis hour, when she wilfully abandoned what certainly appeared the\nflowery track through life, with its luxury, elegance, leisure for\nhigher pursuits, its surroundings of grace and beauty that she\nappreciated so fully, and that only money--ill-gotten or otherwise--can\nprocure?\n\nBut the pride and purity of the spirit forbade any real faltering in her\nresolve. Thousands of other girls lived--contentedly enough she hoped\nand supposed--upon the market value of their poor little capacities.\nUpon what grounds was she to be held different? Young and strong, why\nshould not she work as well as others? She felt she ought to be ashamed\nof herself.\n\nShe shut her eyes so that she should no longer see the tempting wealth\nand elegance she was abandoning.  spirals seemed to whirl in the\ndarkness, and the ensuing giddiness reminded her of her smelling-salts.\nShe slipped the bottle into her hand-bag, then resolved not to sit down\nagain, but to go. She had never before taken a railway journey alone,\nand must allow ample time for contingencies. It was getting on for five\no'clock. The time was ripe.\n\nShe crept from her room, and very softly, with many a pause to listen,\nproceeded to unfasten all hindering chains and locks. But no sound was\nheard within the sleeping flat, and undisturbed she gained the outer\nair.\n\nMorris lay wrapped in slumber, all unconscious that the child he had\nreceived at her dying father's hands, innocent and wholly dependent on\nhis honour, was now stealing forth homeless into the chill morning,\nbroken-hearted, with a sullied story, and but a few pounds between\nherself and utter destitution. Nor, had he known, would it have caused\nhim any serious pangs of remorse. The pride of spirit, the refinement of\nsentiment, that forbade her to take away any of the valuable gifts he\nhad lavished upon her, was totally beyond his comprehension. He could\nsee that it was a pretty enough conceit in theory, perchance, but such a\npiece of high-faluting foolishness put into practice was, to his mind,\nquite sufficient to deprive her of the sympathy of all rational beings.\nIn some peculiar manner the fact that any immediate pecuniary\ndifficulties would be entirely of her own making, was in his mind\nall-sufficient to absolve him from entire blame in the whole affair.\n\nIt was a quarter to six when Evarne arrived at the Gare St. Lazare, and\nlearned that the first train for Dieppe started in five minutes.\nHurrying to the booking-office, she ordered a first single, then\ncontradicted herself, asking for a second-class ticket. It was so\ndifficult to have to remember to economise.\n\nThe slow train, stopping at every station, took six hours to cover the\nground, but Evarne felt no impatience. The steamer did not leave until\nhalf-past one, and until then one place was as satisfactory as any\nother. Indeed, it was even restful to sit quietly in a corner, and not\nhave to force her numbed brain to think and plan.\n\nAbout nine o'clock the train stopped at a station, where she bought a\ncup of coffee and a roll. As she sipped and nibbled she reflected that\nat a corresponding hour on the previous morning she had eaten just such\nanother little _premier d\u00e9jeuner_. How remote then appeared the prospect\nof her very next similar meal being taken thus--parted from Morris for\never, dazed and broken-hearted, bound in solitude and fear for another\nland. \"After all, life ought to be somewhat interesting, for it is\ncertainly unexpected,\" she thought, with a grim, mirthless little smile.\n\nThe Channel being on its best behaviour, she escaped the additional\ntrials of illness, but none the less, on arriving at Newhaven, she felt\nincapable of further effort, and resolved to put up there for the night.\nThe day being Sunday made a good excuse for this feebleness. It really\nwould be most undesirable to arrive in London on the Sabbath evening.\nShe turned with relief into the nearest hotel, and went straight to bed.\n\nShe slept; she lay awake; she trembled beneath evil dreams; she shed\ntears again. The long weary night passed somehow, but left her\nhaggard-eyed and unrefreshed. A maid brought breakfast to her bedside,\nbut Evarne turned with repugnance from the stolid bacon and overdone\npoached eggs, and it was after a mere pretence of a meal that she arose,\npaid her bill, and took her seat in the Victoria train.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIV\n\n                             HELPING HANDS\n\n\nIt was a fresh and beautiful morning when she arrived in London town.\nThe sun shone, the sparrows chirruped merrily, violets and mimosa were\ndisplayed at the street-corners; English spring was at its best. Evarne\nchanged the remainder of her French gold at the station, and then\nwandered out of its main entrance--aimlessly--ignorant of where to\ngo--which way to turn.\n\nIn the station yard she narrowly escaped being run over by the numerous\n'buses that were constantly either entering or leaving. Her first\nimpulse was to mount one of these and let it take her where it would,\nbut condemning this as a foolish fancy, she crossed the road, and\ncommenced to wander down the street directly facing the station. But the\nwide grandeur of Victoria Street was oppressive. She was anxious to find\nthe cheaper parts of London, and get settled in a moderate-priced hotel\nor boarding-house without delay. This feeling of absolute homelessness\nwas dreadful.\n\nShe was passing an attractive-looking refreshment-shop. It was now about\ntwenty to twelve, and at noon she was accustomed to her first serious\nmeal. She became aware that she was sinking for lack of food, and\nentering, ordered something to eat.\n\nThe neighbouring establishment was devoted to the sale of religious\npictures, crucifixes and other church requisites, but taking advantage\nof the great width of the pavement, the enterprising proprietor had\nplaced outside his window some tressels and a board, which was now\ncovered with numerous second-hand books, under the protection of a small\nboy.\n\nAs Evarne ate her meal she distracted her thoughts by watching a girl\nwho was seemingly proposing to purchase a volume, for she was bestowing\nupon them a protracted study. First one was picked up and glanced into,\nthen another, but Evarne soon saw that it was not the printed wisdom\nthat was filling her mind. Every few seconds her eyes cast anxious\nglances in the direction of the station, and ere long she abandoned even\nthe pretence of book-gazing, and stood there, frankly waiting and\nwatching for somebody.\n\nShe had obviously made her toilette with great care and attention to\ndetail. She wore a long coat and a white hat with a black feather\ndrooping over towards her shoulder. She had on spotless white kid gloves\nand smart shoes, and a little bunch of blossoms was fastened at her\nthroat by a small pearl brooch. Noticing all this, Evarne guessed at\nonce what it was that kept this girl loitering about thus long, gazing\nso earnestly towards the station. \"She is in love--I can see plainly.\nLittle fool! It will only bring her misery,\" was the verdict of this\nyoung cynic, for suddenly the far-distant temple at Karnak had risen\nagain in her memory; she could see the cruel eye, the set lips, of the\nEgyptian goddess of Love--of Sekhet--in her implacable silent power.\n\nAt length Evarne felt compelled to take her departure. But to where? Who\ncould advise her? She studied the countenance of the damsel by whom she\nhad been waited upon. It was not unpretty, but oh! so sadly shallow and\nunsympathetic. No kindly aid would be forthcoming from that quarter.\nSilently she quitted the shop.\n\nNot far from the door stood the girl who had already attracted her\nattention. She certainly did not look as if she could be much acquainted\nwith the shifts of poverty, but she did look as if she could be kind and\nwilling to be helpful. Yielding this time to an impulse, Evarne\napproached, and without preamble asked where one could obtain cheap\nlodgings in London.\n\nTo her relief the girl with the plume did not evince the least surprise.\nShe appeared to consider it quite natural to be asked such a question by\na daintily-clad stranger, and calmly proceeded to consider the matter.\n\n\"How cheap do you mean?\" she inquired. \"There are a great many\nboarding-houses in Bloomsbury--near the British Museum, you know--where\nyou would be made quite comfortable for two pounds a week, or even less.\nStill, there are much cheaper ways of living than that, if you prefer.\"\n\nEvarne decided that Fate had guided her to one who was, seemingly, an\nauthority on precisely the class of knowledge she was seeking. Two\npounds a week was certainly very moderate, but when one is possessed of\nless than eight pounds in the world--no, that was beyond her means. She\ncould not allow her whole fortune to be dissipated on a month's riotous\nliving!\n\n\"Please tell me about the cheaper ways. How--do you happen to know where\ngirls live who can only spare one pound a week?\"\n\n\"Well, it chiefly depends on the girl. Some hire cubicles in clubs, or\nhomes, or places of that sort, and get most of their meals out. But it's\nnot nice--they treat you as if you were a child--I've never known any\none with any 'go' in them who liked it. Shall I tell you what I should\ndo myself?\"\n\n\"Yes, please do.\"\n\n\"I should go to the stage-door of this music-hall just here\"--and she\ncarelessly waved her hand in the direction of the edifice she mentioned.\n\"Then ask the doorkeeper for some addresses, and he will tell you where\nthe artistes stay when they are engaged at the hall.\"\n\nHere she broke off, and took a short step sideways in order to see\nbetween the people passing to and fro, but in a minute turned her\nattention again to Evarne.\n\n\"You can get a room and attendance for ten shillings a week, or\nthereabouts, and arrange what you'll eat according to the state of the\nexchequer. I've done that myself, so I know it isn't half-bad. You do\nyour own marketing, you understand, and the landlady does the cooking.\"\n\nSomewhat surprised at this confidence, Evarne thanked her gratefully.\n\n\"Am I not fortunate in having ventured to ask you?\" she said in her\nsweetest voice. \"I should never have dreamed of such a nice way on my\nown account.\"\n\nThe girl with the plume seemed pleased, and accompanied her the few\nsteps to the corner of the side-street in which the stage-entrance of\nthe music-hall was to be found; there they parted, and Evarne proceeded\non her exploring expedition alone. Sure enough, she soon beheld a very\nnarrow, red folding-door, over which \"Stage Door\" appeared enticingly in\nwhite letters. The flaps were already slightly ajar, and, pushing them\nwider open, she peered inside the sacred portals.\n\nThere was a commissionaire's box sure enough, but no official of any\ndescription to grace it. Nothing daunted, Evarne climbed a winding\nflight of stairs that was just ahead. This ended in a big, square\nlanding, on to which opened several doors. All were closed but one,\nwhich, standing wide open, exposed to view a row of washing-basins on a\nhigh table, a portion of uncarpeted floor on which lay a jester's cap\nand a stuffed dog, a huge truss of hay propped up in a corner, together\nwith a couple of guns, and a chair covered with a pile of garments.\n\nSince, save for these rooms, the landing was a blank alley, Evarne was\nabout to descend when a step was heard, and a very young man appeared in\nthe open doorway. Partly with a view to accounting for her trespassing,\nthe girl explained: \"I want to find the hall-porter.\"\n\nThe youth's response was far from useful.\n\n\"Well, he isn't here now, and I don't know where he is, or when he will\nbe back.\"\n\nThe idea came to Evarne that possibly this stranger might serve as well\nas the porter.\n\n\"I wanted to ask if he could tell me of any nice lodgings about here,\"\nshe said.\n\nThe youth at once waxed quite enthusiastic.\n\n\"Well, I can jolly well tell you that! We are staying at the only decent\nplace in the neighbourhood. We go there about four times a year, and we\nwouldn't go to anybody else than Mrs. Burling, not for toffee. When are\nyou coming in?\"\n\n\"I want a room at once.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't say what she's got vacant. We've got--let me see--a\nsitting-room, and one, two, three bedrooms.\"\n\n\"Would you mind telling me what you pay for that?\"\n\n\"Well, we're charged a pound a week for our lot, and that's inclusive,\ncoals and light and everything. I'll give you the address. You can't\nbetter it, I'll take my oath.\"\n\nHe scribbled an address, and Evarne again sought the outer air. At the\ncorner of the street was the girl with the plume, still waiting, who\ninquired after her success.\n\nEvarne showed her the slip of paper.\n\n\"It's the Vauxhall Bridge Road. Is that near by?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh yes; just cross over and go straight ahead, past that clock.\"\n\nBut to get across this crowded thoroughfare was an undertaking that\nEvarne, with her shaken nerves, was scarcely capable of managing. Again\nand again she set out only to return, startled and alarmed, to the\npavement. Undue timidity was so new to her that her pretty brow deepened\ninto wrinkles. It was dreadful that stress of mental suffering should\nhave reduced her to this foolishly weak and incapable condition of mind\nand body.\n\nThe girl with the plume once more came to the rescue.\n\n\"You're not used to London, I can see. I'll take you across. And now\nI'll just show you the right road,\" she continued, when they had reached\nthe opposite pavement in safety.\n\n\"I do hope,\" declared Evarne slyly, \"that nobody specially interesting\nwill happen to come along over there while you are being so kind as to\nsee after me.\"\n\nHer companion looked for a moment as if she had suddenly discovered\nherself to be in the society of a clairvoyante. Then she answered\nlightly enough--\n\n\"It doesn't matter much if she does.\"\n\nBut Evarne was not to be deceived by the feminine pronoun.\n\nIn a couple of minutes the girl with the plume stopped.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, holding out her hand, \"and good luck.\"\n\nEvarne was sorry to have to say farewell. She clasped the hand that was\noffered her.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said roguishly, \"and I do hope that then he--um--I mean\nshe----\"\n\nThe girl with the plume interrupted her by a little laugh of amusement.\nEvarne laughed too, and thus they parted.\n\nIt was just a stray meeting--a momentary friendship never to be\nrenewed--but it put Evarne in a new frame of mind. Whether it was owing\nto the meal, or to having so far forgotten her own woes as to indulge in\nthe fun of bantering another girl, or whether it was to the practical\nkindness and help she had received in finding a _pied-\u00e0-terre_, she knew\nnot; but certainly she walked down Vauxhill Bridge Road with a\nconsiderably brighter expression than heretofore.\n\nThe number found, her knock was answered by Mrs. Burling in person.\nEvarne inquired after accommodation and terms.\n\n\"Are you a pro, miss?\" inquired Mrs. Burling.\n\n\"A pro?\"\n\n\"I mean, are you on the stage yourself? But there, I can see you ain't.\"\n\nThe girl acknowledged it.\n\n\"Does that matter?\"\n\n\"Not a bit; come in, my dear.\"\n\nEvarne entered, and trying to close her nostrils against the smell of\nonions that was wafted along the passage, followed Mrs. Burling into a\nsitting-room. This apartment was overcrowded by a suite of shiny black\nfurniture, and decorated lavishly with antimacassars, and objects of one\ndescription and another under glass cases. The girl thought it hideous,\nand almost unbearable to have to live amid such surroundings.\n\n\"Take a seat, miss. I've only got a 'combined' vacant now, but next\nweek----\"\n\n\"I don't want to pay much,\" confessed Evarne frankly. \"How much is the\n'combined,' and may I see it?\"\n\nShe hadn't the least idea of what a \"combined\" might happen to be, but\nwas not going to display her ignorance twice within the first three\nminutes.\n\nMrs. Burling led the way up a couple of steep flights of stairs, into a\nsmallish room that she herself probably thought charmingly harmonious\nand attractive. Its walls were covered with a dull yellowish paper\nwhereon was a design of pink poppies as big as one's head, with ramping\ngreen leaves of a size to correspond. There were two cupboards painted\nwhite, but picked out with green, while the threadbare carpet was\nlikewise of a verdant hue. By the window was a writing-table, covered\nwith an ink-stained emerald cloth, and the wicker arm-chair that stood\nbefore it tried to render itself cosy and enticing by means of a couple\nof thin cushions--both green, sure enough, but scarcely a happy\ncombination of the shades of that colour to be reposing cheek by jowl.\nIn the corner stood a spotlessly white fluffy-looking bed; there was a\nwardrobe with a disfiguring mirror for the door; a washing-stand--with\nchina pink and green--altogether it was complete enough, but\noh!--Evarne's artistic soul shuddered.\n\nHowever, she had made up her mind that the poor must be easily pleased,\nand on learning that she could become mistress of this domain for ten\nshillings weekly, inclusive, she accepted the position without demur.\n\n\"'Ave you got any more luggage at the station?\" inquired the landlady,\n\"because my Tommy's got a 'and-cart that he can bring it along in.\"\n\nEvarne said that the bag she had left in the hall downstairs was all she\nowned in that direction.\n\n\"It's my custom to ask for part of the rent in advance, miss,\" promptly\nannounced Mrs. Burling.\n\nWithout comment, Evarne meekly opened her purse and produced\nhalf-a-sovereign.\n\n\"Send up my bag, please,\" she said, and in another five minutes found\nherself alone with all her worldly possessions in her first independent\nhome in London. Her new life had indeed started.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XV\n\n                        THE PROBLEM OF EXISTENCE\n\n\nBy the time darkness fell solitude had become unendurable. She did not\nknow a single person in London whom she could visit, so resolved to go\nforth into the open streets. Even to see strangers passing and repassing\nwould be better than the companionship of her own haunting memories.\n\nShe wandered around aimlessly, half-confused and somewhat entertained by\nher first contact with busy London after nightfall. She had soon\nstrolled down Victoria Street, and crossed Westminster Bridge, and was\namid the activity of the populous and poor south side of the Thames.\n\nAfter a while, the sight of a noisy flaring street-market in full swing,\nreminded her that she must make some purchases if she wanted dinner on\nthe morrow. Accordingly--after commencing operations by buying a\ncapacious wicker marketing-basket, in emulation of the busy purchasers\nwho were evidently experienced housewives--she set about considering her\nnext day's _menu_.\n\nDespite her quiet demeanour, she attracted a great deal of notice. Many\nheads were turned to gaze after her; nudgings and whisperings heralded\nher approach. She disliked this attention, and unaware that her face,\napart from its arresting beauty, still bore traces of the emotional\nanguish she had so recently passed through, put it all down to her\nattire. She could not fail to see that her costume--albeit the simplest\nin her late wardrobe--was of an entirely different stamp to that worn by\nher surrounding sister-women, and resolved on the morrow to get a really\ncheap skirt and blouse for such occasions. That night, the purchase of\nfood required all her thought.\n\nAll went off well, save at the butcher's. There she considered she made\na fool of herself! Although it was Monday night, each shop of this\ndescription was surrounded by a crowd of carnivorous humanity. \"Buy,\nbuy, buy!\" the salesman was shouting encouragingly. \"Here's a lovely\nlittle joint. Walk up and look--no call to buy. Prime beef. Buy, buy,\nbuy! Walk up, people, walk up!\"\n\nAt length Evarne followed this advice, and did \"walk up.\" The counter\noutside the shop consisted of a series of divisions marked by numbers\nranging from four to ten, and each containing a mass of smallish\nportions of meat.\n\nThose in number ten partition looked less dried and utterly repulsive\nthan the rest, so, deciding on a tiny piece, the girl daintily touched\nit with the tip of her finger and inquired its price.\n\n\"Tenpence,\" shouted the noisy butcher, darting away to attend to another\ncustomer.\n\nEvarne considered that was far too dear for such a wee portion. She\nwasn't going to be cheated because she was nicely dressed; she just\nwouldn't have that piece! Settling upon a thin chop, she once again made\nbusiness-like inquiries concerning its price. Strange! This was even\nsmaller than her first choice, yet it was tenpence likewise.\n\nThis was really puzzling. Ah! Perhaps it was tenpence a piece,\nregardless of size. It didn't seem likely, but if so, she would see that\nshe got her money's worth, and lifting up the largest portion of all she\nonce more succeeded in attracting the butcher's attention.\n\n\"How much is this bit, then?\" she inquired.\n\nThe unkind butcher man actually got rude. \"Lor' love yer, can't yer 'ear\nme a-telling yer it's _tenpence_, and ain't it printed plain enough?\"\n\nEvarne was affronted by this unaccustomed disrespect.\n\n\"I'll take this piece, then,\" she announced with the air of a duchess,\nwhereupon the man, in no ways abashed, promptly flung it out of sight\nunder a row of hanging joints, into the interior of the shop.\n\nEvarne remained stationary.\n\n\"Walk inside, miss,\" cried the man, as the crowd jostled, and others\nclaimed his attention.\n\nThe girl obeyed. In its turn her choice was put on the scales.\n\n\"Thirteen ounces, sevenpence-halfpenny,\" cried the weigher, wrapping it\nup with all speed in a bit of newspaper and handing it over.\n\nOnly then did it dawn on Evarne that this universal price of tenpence\nmeant nothing more nor less than tenpence a pound, and thus the mystery\nwas explained! Until recently she would have laughed merrily over such\nan incident, but now all life was the colour of tragedy. She saw in this\nabsurd little incident only an allegory of her all-round practical\nignorance, her incapacity, her sordid position, and the general misery\nand humiliation of her probable future. She returned home weary and\ndejected, and that night likewise soaked her pillow with tears.\n\nShe breakfasted in bed, then dressed and went out to get a newspaper to\nstudy the list of situations vacant. Buying two or three she inquired\nthe way to the nearest public gardens. The policeman directed her to\nHyde Park, and ere long she was seated facing the Row, idly watching the\nequestrians as they cantered past.\n\nHow cheerful, how light-hearted, they all seemed!\n\nPeople on foot, even though richly clad, often looked discontented and\nill-natured. Those driving in the finest of motors, or the most splendid\nof carriages, with prancing horses and all outward tokens of luxury,\nmight appear dreadfully bored with existence; but one and all who were\nmounted upon these well-groomed steeds on this fresh spring morning\nappeared to radiate health and happiness as they passed.\n\nIt was scarcely a kind Fate that brought Evarne to this spot, with the\nvery papers in her hand in which she hoped to find the printed\nannouncement of some quiet little corner in the labour market into which\nshe might creep to earn mere bread and cheese. She looked with eyes that\nwere frankly envious upon the riders. How unfair it seemed that some\npeople should have so much money and others none at all unless they\neither slaved or sinned.\n\nHad she been plunged into poverty with Morris still true--still loving\nher--she could have faced the turn of Fortune's wheel with a stout heart\nand a cheery smile. But the stroke that had been dealt to her affections\nseemed to have crushed her very spirit.\n\nNor had she any, save her own moral resources, upon which to lean for\nsupport. This would have seemed a period when the glorious and elevating\ninfluence of Socrates should have had power to lift her into lofty\nrealms of philosophical resignation. But for the greatest of her griefs,\nthe most gnawing, the most unendurable, the teacher was worse than\nuseless. Scant comfort does he give to those whose love is unhappy. On\nthe contrary, his words, his ideas, as they had been interpreted by\nEvarne, merely served to gall the wound, and she dared not dwell upon\nthem.\n\nShe did not open her papers, but sat watching the passing throng. She\nsmiled as two little girls came galloping by at full speed. They rode\nastride, and a groom led the pony of the youngest by a leading-rein. The\nhats of both tiny maidens had blown back, their flying curls rose and\nfell, their faces were flushed bright pink with excitement and delight.\nNext a young woman rode past at a walking pace. By her side was a man.\nShe too looked radiantly happy, but it was not the exhilaration of\nexercise that had brought that glad light into her eyes. Evarne looked\nafter them sympathetically. Although her own story had ended in\ndestruction and misery, she still found a pair of earnest young lovers\nthe most interesting--the most attractive--sight in the world.\n\nNumbers of elderly rotund gentlemen trotted along. For them the morning\nride was but a doctor's prescription--still, they took it with a\ncheerful countenance--this delightful recipe! Then passed two women,\nboth evidently over fifty; they still possessed elegant and slender\nfigures, shown off by immaculate habits. They were mounted on\nmagnificent horses--lithe, powerful, big--horses fit to carry heavy men,\nand to whom the weight of these slight women must have been a mere\nnothing. Evarne imagined that these two riders were wealthy maiden\nsisters--the great ladies of some country district--who came to London\njust for the season. She fancied they had lived side by side in state\nand dignity from infancy upwards, and that there had never been a hero\nin the story of either of their lives.\n\nImmediately after them came a golden-haired damsel--gay, _d\u00e9bonnaire_,\nhandsome--but marred by an irrefutable touch of vulgarity. Her fine form\nand shady morals had gone to make her a prosperous career! Her life had\nnever been without a hero. Next came a youthful and highborn mother,\ncantering easily, looking down with smiling care and pride upon the\ngallant little son and heir who rode so manfully beside her on a shaggy\nwhite pony. Ah! there was life, happiness, health, wealth,\nlove--everything! But she must waste no more time. Moving to a less\nprominent seat she opened her papers.\n\nDoubtless if Evarne had been an artistic genius she would have declined\nto abandon entirely the pursuit of art. As it was, knowing her own\nincompetence, she at once hopelessly renounced all ideas of art as a\nprofession. What then offered itself? If she had happened to possess a\nknowledge of shorthand there were many openings, but then she didn't\nhappen to, so that was no use! A smart girl about eighteen was wanted to\nassist in a grill-room and make herself generally useful. A stifling\ngrill-room! Horrible! Some bakers required a young lady as bookkeeper\nand to assist in shop. Arithmetic had never been her strong point. A\nbarmaid was wanted. Heaven forbid! Another lady was required to push the\nboot trade. \"Pushing\" anything was also not her strong point.\n\nThe \"C's\" were all cashiers and clerks. Arithmetic and shorthand again.\nUseless! Oh, there was also a demand for cooks. Well, she could boil\neggs and potatoes, and make toast, but that was hardly sufficient.\nDrapery establishments required ladies for various departments. That was\ndecidedly the most promising so far. She would write to some of these.\nDressmakers wanted hands, assistants, improvers and apprentices. Oh\ndear, dear! Several hotels wanted manageresses or housekeepers, and an\ninfirmary required a female lunatic attendant. It was terribly\ndisheartening work. Lady canvassers--that again required the gift of\nbeing pushing. Laundry-managers--mantle-machinists--milliners--servants.\nThere ended the choice. Appalling!\n\nHowever, she proceeded to answer a few of the advertisements, when the\nidea came to consult Mrs. Burling. The landlady was a practical\nworking-woman, and therefore perhaps the very best possible adviser.\n\nSo Evarne to a certain extent became confidential. What did Mrs. Burling\nthink was the easiest way of earning a livelihood for a girl who had not\nbeen taught any profession, and who, owing to deaths and unexpected\nlosses, found herself obliged to earn money right away?\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Mrs. Burling suggested the stage. This\nwas not unnatural, considering that the worthy matron spent her days\nwaiting hand and foot upon plain, commonplace women and inane men, who,\nby that means, contrived to lead leisured lives. That was the one and\nonly trade, business or profession she knew of that seemed to call for\nneither brains, industry, previous preparation, nor--in her opinion--any\nparticular talent or qualification whatsoever.\n\n\"I do assure you, miss,\" she went on, \"I've 'ad ladies and gents 'ere\nearning good money, who would 'ave been in the work'ouse if they wasn't\nin the profession.\"\n\nEvarne considered. She was blankly ignorant of everything connected with\nlife behind the scenes. True, she had met several so-called \"actresses\"\nin the society of Morris's friends, but these ladies never seemed to be\nacting, so she could not consider that they represented the genuine\narticle. She had a vague idea--gleaned from she scarce knew where--that\nthe men of the dramatic world were all vulgar and vain and familiar and\ninclined to drink, unless, on the other hand, they were popular,\nfascinating and romantic; while the women were jealous, rather rowdy,\nand overdressed, until those upper ranks were reached wherein they\nfigured on picture postcards, when they were models of every public and\ndomestic virtue. Still, to the girl's imagination, a stage life\ncertainly seemed far more bearable than the vision of herself measuring\nout lace and ribbon from morn to eve; or serving round grilled chops; or\nfighting with lunatics.\n\n\"I really think I shall try that,\" she announced at length; \"but I'm\ndreadfully ignorant about how to get a post. Does one go to the\ntheatres, or write to the leading actors, or the managers, or what?\"\n\n\"There's all sorts of ways,\" declared Mrs. Burling. \"For one thing, you\nmust 'ave a good photo of yourself to send round. What 'ave you got?\"\n\nEvarne confessed that she had nothing.\n\n\"Then you must 'ave one took, and 'ave sticky-backs made from it.\"\n\n\"Sticky-backs?\"\n\n\"Yes, fifty a shilling. Don't you know 'em? I've got some stuck in my\nvisitors' book. I'll get it, and let you see.\"\n\nShe returned in due course and presented the volume.\n\n\"I've got a message for you,\" she went on. \"I jist mentioned to the\nladies and gents in the sitting-room, when I went in to git the book,\nwhat I wanted it for, and when they 'eard you'd never bin on the stage\nand was thinking of starting, they sent up an invite that if you'd take\nsupper with 'em when they return from the 'all this evening, they'd be\nvery 'appy to give you some advice.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is kind of them,\" declared Evarne with alacrity. \"Will you\ntell them I'll be very pleased to accept?\"\n\nMrs. Burling took her departure, and the girl amused herself by studying\nthe visitors' book. Clearly, no praise of the worthy landlady was deemed\ntoo exaggerated, and quite often tactful self-advertisements had been\nunblushingly inserted by the writers. Evarne studied the method by which\nit was achieved, with a view to future use. Thus \"Wally Wentworth, Mrs.\nWally Wentworth and Miss Arundale Sutherland, on highly successful\nreturn visit with sketch, 'The Perils of the Dark,' stopped here, and\nfound complete satisfaction with both cooking and accommodation.\" Very\ningenious!\n\nAnother, a gentleman whose jolly countenance was preserved to future\nages through the medium of a \"sticky-back,\" declared--\n\n\"Owing to being braced up by Mother Burling's high-class cookery, sang\n'Cats a-walking on the tiles' and 'Lazy Lily's Lullaby' as never before!\nBrought down the house!\"\n\n\"The Giggling <DW53> Girls\" were also full of praises of Mrs. Burling, but\ndid not forget to add that at the music hall they were \"encored\nnightly.\"\n\nEvarne was quite carried away by the childish self-complacency, the\nlight-hearted tone of gaiety that pervaded this book, and began to wax\nquite enthusiastic over the idea of going on the stage herself. Perhaps\nshe would be a great success, and become famous, and earn any amount of\nmoney. Then Morris, of course, would hear of her triumphs, and\nthen----But she stayed these fairy visions with a stern hand as soon as\nMorris appeared in them. The pain grew too cruel. Nothing could ever\nundo the past.\n\nShe wondered if she could act well. She had never had any ambition in\nthat direction, and so had never tried, not even as an amateur. But\nsurely anyone could learn to undertake small parts quite easily. She did\nnot expect to be called upon to play \"Juliet\" or \"Pauline Deschapelles\"\nimmediately.\n\nThe hours passed. She found an old novelette in a drawer, and occupied\nher time in reading the rubbish, until a scream of laughter, the bang of\na door and a general sense of uproar, proclaimed that the \"sketch party\"\nhad returned from its evening labours. A few minutes later a tap came on\nthe door, and in response to the injunction to \"Come in,\" a tall,\nslender girl, with faint traces of \"make-up\" still clinging around her\neyes, appeared on the threshold.\n\n\"We've come back, Miss Stornway,\" she announced in a friendly manner,\n\"and I've come up to bring you down to have a bit of supper with us as\narranged.\"\n\nWillingly enough Evarne went downstairs. The meal was laid in readiness\nin the sitting-room, where two men and a buxom middle-aged female, all\nlounging around waiting for the first course to appear, seemed to fill\nthe already overfurnished place to repletion.\n\nThe girl who had run up to conduct the guest downstairs now undertook\nthe task of effecting a general introduction.\n\n\"This is Mr. Hal Cuthbert, the manager of our 'Fun in the Hayfield'\nsketch company,\" she commenced, indicating the elder of the two men.\n\"This is Mrs. Hal Cuthbert.\" The lady in question bowed so deliberately\nand graciously that Evarne felt constrained to solemnly return the\nformal salutation. \"This is Mr. Bertie Anderson.\" Here the girl\nexchanged smiles with her acquaintance at the hall. \"My name is Margaret\nMacclesfield, and you are Miss Stornway, so now we all know one\nanother.\"\n\nEveryone hereupon started to speak at once, but Mrs. Burling appearing\nwith a dish of soused mackerel, all subsided for a moment, took their\nseats, and the little meal commenced.\n\nVery soon Evarne arrived at the conclusion that if this party was\ntypical of theatrical ladies and gentlemen, she had been vastly mistaken\nin her estimate of such. They were evidently not unlike ordinary human\nbeings, only rather jollier. They were very lively, very light-hearted,\neasily amused at not remarkably brilliant witticisms, whether the\nproduct of their own genius or that of their companions. They were,\nmoreover, exceedingly frank and open, telling her all about themselves,\ntheir whole history and that of their respective families. They waxed\nenthusiastic on their past dramatic successes and their future\nhopes--future fears they seemed not to possess. Altogether Evarne quite\nforgot herself, and enjoyed the chatter after her period of involuntary\nsolitude. It was not until the meal was over, and tobacco fumes filled\nthe air, that the subject of her future on the stage was mooted.\n\nBut this little band of professionals was far less sanguine and\nencouraging than Mrs. Burling had been.\n\nMr. Hal Cuthbert opened the debate.\n\n\"It's a dreadfully overcrowded profession you are thinking of embarking\non, Miss Stornway, and unless you have influence or money, even talent\nhas a hard fight.\"\n\n\"I have no influence, and very little money, and I don't really know\nthat I've got any special talent,\" declared this applicant for stage\nhonours, making no attempt to conceal the true state of affairs.\n\nMr. Cuthbert shook his head portentously.\n\n\"That is not a very hopeful prospect,\" he declared. \"Haven't you got a\nvoice? There's a piano yonder. Let's hear what you can do.\"\n\nEvarne in her turn shook her head. \"I'm afraid I can't sing,\" she said\nregretfully. \"I've never had my voice trained at all.\"\n\nA momentary silence seized the party.\n\n\"Perhaps you can dance?\" suggested Margaret Macclesfield, hopefully.\n\n\"Only ordinary ballroom dances.\"\n\n\"That's no go,\" and a silence still more melancholy, more profound, held\nsway.\n\n\"There's no place for you on the halls, then. Perhaps you'd do all right\nin legitimate drama. Can you recite something?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't know anything dramatic,\" Evarne was obliged to\nconfess, her cheeks growing pinker. \"I don't know much poetry at all,\nand what I have learnt from time to time are only pretty little bits\nthat have taken my fancy.\"\n\n\"Dear me----\" Mr. Cuthbert was recommencing, when his wife broke in--\n\n\"Don't you do it, my dear. It's a dreadful profession for them as\nhaven't got the gifts. It's a grinding, killing business. I'd as soon\nsee a girl of mine in her grave.\"\n\n\"The old lady isn't far wrong,\" agreed Mr. Cuthbert. \"You take my\nadvice, Miss Stornway, and try something else.\"\n\n\"But,\" declared Evarne despairingly, \"whatever I tried it would be just\nthe same. I--I'm not properly qualified for anything. It's not my fault,\nbut there it is! I didn't think of the stage when I found I'd got to\nearn my own living, but now it has been suggested to me I feel sure I\nstand a better chance of earning money quickly that way than any other.\"\n\n\"You've got a real beautiful face, if you don't mind my being personal,\"\nsaid Margaret. \"Perhaps you might get a thinking part, right enough--or\nthere's pantomime. You're tall, aren't you? If you've got good legs and\na fine figure----What's your waist?\"\n\nYet once again Evarne was compelled to shake her head apologetically.\n\n\"I'm afraid----\" she started, then stopped abruptly. However, frankness\nseemed to prevail here, so she continued after an imperceptible pause.\n\"I don't think I've got what you mean by a fine figure. I need very\ncareful and special dressing to look really nice. You see, I don't wear\ncorsets, and so----\"\n\n\"My dear!\" interrupted both ladies simultaneously, \"how can you manage\nwithout?\"\n\n\"Well, I was brought up to it,\" explained the girl hastily.\n\n\"I should feel as if I'd got no backbone.\"\n\n\"I couldn't keep up. I should flop.\"\n\n\"But you can wear some now if you like.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I can't do. I tried once, quite seriously, and it\nmade me ill--really ill--and I don't suppose it gets any easier to\nchange one's habits as one gets older.\"\n\nMrs. Cuthbert flourished her hands despairingly.\n\n\"It's no go, my dear. Put the idea of the stage out of your head at\nonce. No voice, no talents, no experience, no money, and no waist!\"\n\nA general cry of expostulation greeted this rather cruel _r\u00e9sum\u00e9_ of\npoor Evarne's deficiencies.\n\n\"You've got a lovely face anyway, my dear,\" said Mr. Hal, \"and you look\nto have a nice figure, whether you have really or not, if I may say as\nmuch. I think the old lady's advice is good, but you mustn't let your\nfeelings be hurt.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" declared the girl stoutly. \"It's only too good of\nyou to trouble about me at all, and you mustn't think me either vain or\nungrateful if I say that I am still resolved to try my luck. I believe I\ncould act, and I've never yet found my personal appearance a\ndisadvantage to me; I expect that, even without corsets, I can manage to\nlook as well as the average girl. I must start to earn money at once,\nthat's sadly certain. I've been thinking over every other means, and\nnone of them seem suitable, so if you would end up your kindness by\ngiving me some hints as to how to get work on the stage at once I shall\nbe infinitely obliged.\"\n\nTheir good-nature in no way disturbed by their unanimous judgment being\nthus flouted, they gave her advice as best they could. Like Mrs.\nBurling, they declared it was imperative she should have some photos of\nherself to send round. Then she must go to agents, and answer\nadvertisements in the theatrical papers, and--well, really it was hard\nto say, engagements came somehow--if any of them got a chance they would\ncertainly put in a word for her.\n\nFor this she was duly grateful, and a little later the party broke up.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XVI\n\n                       EVARNE'S FIRST ENGAGEMENT\n\n\nNext morning, accompanied by the two younger of her new acquaintances,\nEvarne sallied forth in search of a photographer's.\n\nCarefully they studied various photographic show-cases of modest\npretensions. She was reluctant to spend any of her limited capital in so\nseemingly frivolous a manner, and was anxious to expend as small a sum\nas possible on this preliminary. But here it was clearly possible to be\n\"penny wise, pound foolish,\" and she recoiled at the prospect of being\nmade to look anything like the self-conscious, staring, pictured females\nthat the really low-priced artists of the camera set forth as attractive\nproducts of their prowess--the specimens best calculated to tickle the\nvanity of the passers-by and draw them into the toils of the producer of\nsuch representations.\n\nAt length they discovered one whose masterpieces seemed less terrible\nthan those of his rivals. Margaret undertook the _r\u00f4le_ of spokesman.\n\n\"Only one copy of each position is required,\" she said, \"but they must\nbe delivered without delay, as the young lady is on the stage, and needs\nthem immediately for professional purposes,\" and she went on to bargain\nabout reduced prices.\n\nAfter the operator's shutter had made its significant click two or three\ntimes, the party wended their way to the Strand, and Evarne had her name\nduly inscribed upon several agents' books. In some cases this privilege\ncost money, and she returned home horrified by the rapidity with which\nfunds melted. True, Bertie Anderson had \"stood\" both girls their\nluncheon, but despite this, the day's output had been something\nalarming.\n\nEveryone in the house continued to concern themselves over her welfare.\nIndeed, from the first hour of her arrival in London she had met with\nnothing but goodwill. Herein Heaven watched over her, for this general\nkindliness on the part of mankind at large was the best possible balm\nfor her scorned and wounded affections. True, no care from others could\nreally touch the injury inflicted by \"the one,\" but it all served to\nhelp melt the ice that seemed gathered around her breast.\n\nHer acquaintance with the merry, good-natured \"Fun in the Hayfield\"\npeople proved a veritable salvation. Left to herself for any appreciable\nperiod, she weakly sank into a state of brooding despair, but save for\nthe evening of the \"photographer-hunting\" day, she was in their society\nfor practically the whole of the remainder of the week.\n\nMr. Cuthbert had offered to pass her into the music hall that night, but\nshe declined the offer. She was tired, and shrank from the anticipated\nnoise and glare. But once alone she regretted her decision. Memories of\nthe past crowded thick upon her, with their train of regrets, hot\nindignation, bitter sorrow, and the thousand and one tearing passions\nthat rendered thought unendurable. Solitude was--for the present at\nleast--but a state of torture to be avoided at all costs. Distraction,\ncompany, variety was no longer a matter of choice, but an absolute\nnecessity. She had vainly endeavoured to find relief from the agony of\nthought by mingling with the passing crowds. Despairing, she returned\nhome and to bed, but her brain had worked itself into a tumult during\nthe long evening hours, and no sleep came. Long she lay awake, weeping,\nhating, yearning and lamenting.\n\n\"You look paler than ever, Evarne, my dear! Whatever have you been doing\nto yourself?\" cried Margaret, who came up to present her with some\nchocolates from a box that some admiring \"chap\" had sent round to the\nstage door. She was in high feather over the little gift.\n\n\"People think we get so many flowers given us we haven't vases to put\nthem in, and so many pairs of gloves we haven't hands enough to wear\nthem, and so many sweeties we haven't digestions enough to tackle them\nall, let alone cheques and presents of jewellery about once a week!\" she\nexclaimed; \"but I assure you that's a jolly big mistake, as you'll find\nout, dear. Come on, tuck in to chocs and take some of this row. They've\ngot pinky cream, and you'll have to put some colour on from the outside,\nif you can't manage to provide it somehow from the inside,\" and she\nlaughed gaily.\n\n\"I do hate to be alone,\" explained Evarne, brightening visibly at the\neffect of this chatter. \"I--I've had great trouble lately, and when I'm\nby myself--well--I think!\"\n\nMargaret was full of sympathy.\n\n\"Poor dear, don't 'think' then, don't be alone. I know what we will do.\nI'm going to order Mrs. Burling to serve your meals along with ours, and\nwe will see if we can't cheer you up among us.\"\n\n\"I should like that,\" cried Evarne, jumping at the idea. Thus until the\nfollowing Sunday, when these kind friends moved on to play their\n\"sketch\" in a hall right out of London, she was scarcely left alone for\nan hour. Every night she went with Mrs. Cuthbert and Margaret to their\ndressing-room, where she assisted in arraying them, and was instructed\nin the many mysteries of \"making-up.\" She learnt many things--the knack\nof melting cosmetic in a teaspoon and applying it to the eyelashes with\na hairpin--how to fluff out her hair by combing it the wrong way--how to\ntransform a skin of common lard into glorified face-grease, sweetly\nsmelling of essence of bergamot--and a dozen other little tricks of the\ntrade.\n\nEither Margaret or Bertie accompanied her on her daily visits to\nthe agents, and on Thursday morning--albeit she had as yet no\n\"sticky-backs\"--they helped her study the new number of the _Stage_. Her\nexperienced friends warned her that the approach of summer was not a\nfavourable time to find \"a shop.\"\n\nNevertheless there seemed to Evarne a goodly and various demand in the\n\"Wanted\" column. There were openings for pretty attractive chorus girls,\nsoubrettes, a good responsible lady, a powerful leading lady, a pathetic\nold lady, a show lady, an emotional juvenile lady, and a dashing heavy\nlady; and if one couldn't place one's self under any of these\ndescriptions, then one could modestly seek to be a \"chambermaid.\" Also\nthere were sweeping invitations for whole companies to \"write in.\"\nAccordingly Evarne \"wrote in\"--spent 1s. 3d. on stamps--then waited.\n\nAt the end of the week she was forced to part from her kind friends. She\nassured them that for their sakes she would henceforward and forever\ncherish an affectionate regard for the whole of the theatrical\nfraternity. Faithful promises of correspondence were exchanged, and then\nthe girl found herself thrown upon her own society.\n\nMrs. Burling had already let her sitting-room for the coming week, but\nthe two men who now occupied it--low comedians--appeared to fastidious\nEvarne as very low specimens of humanity likewise. So, when one of\nthem--encountering her on the front doorstep--showed a tendency to be\naffable, she received the poor fellow's effort most coolly.\n\nHowever, her time was now fully occupied. She marketed daily, haunted\nthe theatrical agents, read poetry aloud in her best dramatic style in\nthe privacy of her room, and occasionally expended a shilling on the\ngallery of some theatre to study acting and find out how it was done.\n\nBy the time the next theatrical paper appeared, she was the owner of\nfifty small replicas of the most attractive of her new photographs, and\nshe desperately set to work to answer almost every advertisement--likely\nand unlikely. Alack and alas, not a single response crowned her efforts!\n\nThen she nearly sank into utter despondency. Whatever was to be done? No\nwork forthcoming, and her little hoard of money melting away like snow\nin a thaw. Why, it was enough to test the fortitude of the bravest! She\nwas almost in despair by the time she had been in London two weeks, and\nwas still as far from being a wage-earner as when she first arrived.\n\nSo the reaction was correspondingly great, when a day or two later she\nbeheld a letter for herself with a Scotch postmark and addressed in a\nstrange handwriting. Mrs. Burling--sympathetically excited--had hurried\nupstairs with the precious missive and proceeded to wipe some imaginary\ndust from a vase, while her young lodger tore open the envelope.\n\nThe notepaper was headed \"Caledonia's Bard Co.,\" and beneath this was\nprinted a few puffs of the aforesaid concern, which--if one went by its\nown account--carried a full cast of the most talented artistes, rich and\nhandsome costumes, realistic scenery, etc.\n\nThe written address given was Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, and the\nletter stated that the manager of \"Caledonia's Bard\" offered \"the small\nyet effective part\" of \"Bess\" in that production to Miss Stornway, at\nthe remuneration of twenty-one shillings weekly. Miss Stornway was to\nprovide her own costumes, which, however, were of the simplest\ndescription, and should she be still at liberty to accept the offer, a\ngentleman would call upon her to deliver into her hands a railway ticket\nto Glasgow. The communication was signed \"P. Punter.\"\n\nIts recipient beamed.\n\n\"I've got an offer, really!\" she exclaimed. \"Would you like to see it?\"\nWith these words she handed the letter over to Mrs. Burling, who perused\nit slowly from start to finish, then sniffed.\n\n\"A guinea a week, find your own dresses, and go to Glasgow! 'Tain't up\nto much, to my way o' thinking, miss. And 'e don't tell you when the\ntour opens, nor where it ends up, nor no idea of 'ow long it's going to\nlast, nor nothing about it.\"\n\nEvarne had not noticed these deficiencies, and now did not heed them.\n\n\"Never mind! It's an engagement, and that's everything,\" she cried\ngleefully. \"I shall hurry up and accept before someone else does;\" and\nseizing pen and paper she wrote her reply.\n\nAt all events \"P. Punter\" appeared a prompt and businesslike individual.\nBy return of post came a couple of pencil sketches and instructions\nconcerning the costumes she was to provide for herself. There was also\nan illegibly written copy of her part, and the request that she would be\nin Glasgow to commence rehearsals by the following Wednesday.\n\nEvarne smoothed out that most interesting document--the script of her\nfirst dramatic _r\u00f4le_--and studied it eagerly. She supposed \"Caledonia's\nBard\" was Robert Burns, for references to \"Bobbie\" were frequent. She\ncould not glean much idea of the plot from her part, nor did the words\nshe was to utter appear likely to call forth any great histrionic talent\nthat might be lying unsuspected within her breast. As far as she could\ngather, all the scenes of the play took place by the deathbed of\n\"Highland Mary.\" She read out a speech to Mrs. Burling as a specimen.\n\n\"Now lie ye still, bonnie Mary, lie ye still. Sure, Bobbie will greet\nsair to see ye laid sae low. For his sake, Mary, ye must get the roses\nback agin into your bonnie cheeks, now sae white, Mary. Oh, doctor, is\nshe no a wee bit better, think ye?\"\n\nThus it went on. \"Bonnie Mary\" was obviously a most obstreperous\npatient, and it evidently called forth all \"Bess's\" powers of persuasion\nto make her die quietly in bed. \"Mary\" apparently took to seeing visions\nas the play waxed more thrilling, and \"Bess\" was required to employ\n\"gentle strength\" to persuade her charge to obey the injunction,\nrepeated with wearying reiteration, \"Rest ye calm, Mary; rest ye calm.\"\nIndeed, the idea did flash across Evarne that she might almost as well\nhave undertaken to tend lunatics in the privacy of an infirmary, as she\nwas seemingly to do much the same sort of thing on the boards and under\nthe public gaze.\n\n\"It's not very inspiring, is it?\" she said rather despondently, but at\nthe same time she was relieved to find that no serious demands were to\nbe made upon her--as yet untried--dramatic abilities.\n\nShe went out to buy the brown serge and the blue cotton material\nnecessary for her two costumes, and on her return was told that during\nher absence a gentleman from Scotland had called and gone.\n\n\"It must be my ticket,\" exclaimed the girl. \"Didn't he leave it?\"\n\nMrs. Burling handed her an envelope. In it Evarne found the return-half\nof a third-class ticket from Glasgow to London.\n\n\"Dear me, we are going to break the regulations of the railway company,\nI see,\" was her first thought.\n\nHowever, the arrival of the ticket seemed to make the engagement real--a\nsettled fact. She was now fully in the throes of an actress's life. As\nshe sat studying her part and stitching away at her stage costumes, she\nrecalled the early days of Mrs. Siddons and various other great\ntheatrical stars, and tried hard to feel resigned concerning the past\nand the present, and hopeful for the future. She determined to force\nherself to become ambitious. She would live for and think only of\nprofessional success, and dream no more of Morris.\n\nMore of her precious money had to be expended. A \"make-up\" outfit was\nessential, also a small theatrical touring basket, together with several\nother more or less expensive items. Thus by the time she had settled her\nfinal account with Mrs. Burling, there was less than two pounds in her\npurse with which to set forth for Glasgow.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XVII\n\n                A STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE PROFESSION\n\n\nDepositing her box at the Glasgow station left-luggage office, she set\nout to discover Sauchiehall Street. In this, of course, no difficulty\narose, but when it came to finding the actual house--well, that appeared\na total impossibility. Evarne was almost inclined to believe that she\nhad come to Scotland on a wild-goose chase, for there seemed to exist no\nsuch address as that with which Mr. Punter had headed his letters. There\nwas the number above and the number below the very one she required, but\nbetween them--where the house she sought would naturally have been\nexpected to stand--was merely a piece of unused building ground.\n\nIt was a forlorn, unkempt spot, with straggling grasses and weeds, amid\nwhich were piles of bricks and stone, fragments of torn paper, an old\nboot, and other such d\u00e9bris as will accumulate on waste ground, even\nthough it be in the very centre of the principal street of a big city.\nAs if to make it serve at least one useful purpose, there had been\nerected on it an enormous hoarding, covered with advertisements.\n\nHere was a regular mystery! Inquiries respecting the address she was\nseeking were vain. She walked anxiously up and down Sauchiehall Street,\nhalf hoping to find the missing number somehow transported from its\nlegitimate numerical position, but all to no avail. Again and again she\nreturned to survey the deserted site where Mr. Punter's residence\n_ought_ to be. Unless he camped in the shadow of the hoarding, as did\none or two stray cats--a sudden thought flashed across her! Pushing past\nthe small gate that hung partly open on its hinges, and ploughing her\nway through the long grass, she penetrated round to the back of the\nhoarding. There it was, after all--a house sure enough--partly tumbled\ndown, it is true, with broken windows, fallen chimneys, and a general\nair of having been long abandoned by mankind; still, a house, even\nthough half the roof had collapsed. More than that; close by, on a large\nwooden frame, hung a roughly painted theatrical drop-scene. The place\nwas found!\n\nBut what a habitation for a civilised human being! What sort of a person\nwas Mr. Punter? Was he a gipsy--a tramp? Was he in the last stages of\npoverty, or merely eccentric? The girl approached the front door. Its\nupper half was formed of thick panels of stained glass, now cracked and\nbroken in a dozen places, but with brown paper carefully pasted on the\ninner side to cover the actual holes. Knocking boldly with the end of\nher umbrella, Evarne waited, though half prepared to receive no answer.\n\nBut after a moment's silence there came a sound of a window being thrown\nopen, and a voice called out from somewhere aloft, \"Hullo!\"\n\nShe stepped back and looked upwards. A youth, wrapped in a blanket, was\ngazing down upon her.\n\n\"Oh, I suppose you are Madame Sheep, or Miss Stornway?\" he exclaimed.\n\"Stop a minute, and I'll be down.\"\n\nWith these words he vanished.\n\nDecidedly \"intrigued,\" the girl waited patiently. How very unlike was\nthis reception to anything her wildest imagination had anticipated. An\ninhabited ruin, the occupant thereof clad in the bedclothes, peering\ndown from an upper window to inquire if she was herself or some person\nwho possessed the weird name of \"Madame Sheep!\" She felt as if it were\npart of a ridiculous dream.\n\nFinally, the door was opened, not by the blanketed youth, but by a\nmiddle-aged man, small and short, with a head beginning to grow bald and\na face clean-shaven, save for curious old-fashioned side-whiskers.\n\nHailing the girl by name with the heartiness of an old friend, he led\nthe way across the hall and into a large room on the ground floor. It\nwas totally unfurnished, save for a rough wooden table, a bench and a\ncouple of chairs. On one of these Evarne was invited to take a seat.\n\nYes, this little individual was \"the\" Mr. Punter in person. He proceeded\nto hold forth in enthusiastic terms concerning the future prospects of\n\"Caledonia's Bard.\" The play had never been produced yet, that was why\nhe had advertised for a full company. He anticipated that it would run\nfor years. Not that he expected to be able to retain the original\ncompany all that time. Every part was so splendid--practically all were\nstar-parts--that the artistes who had the good fortune to appear in them\nwould soon be tempted away from him by London managers. Oh no, he hadn't\nwritten the drama himself. He only wished he was sufficiently gifted.\nBut he was very proud to be able to acknowledge that it was, indeed, the\nfruit of the genius of one of his family. Such an inspiring subject. He\nhad an intense admiration for Robert Burns. Was Miss Stornway, indeed,\nnot intimately acquainted with the whole of that wonderful poet's works?\nOh dear! dear! That was distressing, and must be remedied. She should be\nlent a book--several books. Mr. Sandy, the great actor who was to play\nthe title _r\u00f4le_, knew nearly all Burns's poems by heart, and it was\nchiefly owing to his appreciation of the acute study of the poet's\ncharacter, in \"Caledonia's Bard,\" that he had resolved to disappoint\nseveral other managers in order to join this company. The young lady who\nplayed \"Highland Mary,\" the heroine, had not arrived yet. She lived in\nNorthumberland. A really excellent actress, only second to Ellen Terry.\nMr. Punter had gone to great expense to procure her services. Madame\nCheape--not Sheep, my dear--was the \"Clarinda.\" This spacious apartment\nhad been retained especially for rehearsals.\n\nThus he ran on, apparently in emulation of Tennyson's brook, and Evarne\nhad nothing to do but look intelligent, and interpose a brief question\noccasionally to show that she was attending.\n\nHe only ceased when the door opened to admit a little woman who had\napproached unheard. The newcomer was very pale, and looked fragile and\nsubdued. Her thin hair was drawn neatly behind her ears, her shabby\nblack gown hung in folds over her flat chest, and she slouched in list\nslippers so many sizes too large that had she ventured to lift her feet\nin walking, she would inevitably have stepped out of her footgear, and\nleft it behind her on the floor.\n\n\"Ah ha! Allow me to introduce my wife,\" said Mr. Punter.\n\nEvarne rose and shook hands.\n\n\"How do you like your part?\" was the salutation of the lady of the\nhouse.\n\nThe girl discreetly avoided a direct answer.\n\n\"It has made me very anxious to hear the whole play.\"\n\nFortunately the little woman considered this response as entirely\nsatisfactory. She smiled complacently, and commenced to nod her head so\nsteadily, it appeared in danger of becoming loosened.\n\nMr. Punter likewise seemed to swell with pride. At length he could keep\nthe great secret no longer.\n\n\"I may as well tell you first as last, Miss Stornway. You are now\naddressing the authoress of 'Caledonia's Bard.'\"\n\nEvarne was indeed taken aback at this piece of information. Barely\nsucceeding in suppressing a start, she murmured something she fondly\nhoped was duly appropriate to the occasion. Evidently she was\nsuccessful, for Mrs. Punter ceased nodding, and thanked her heartily.\n\n\"And now, where are you going to put up, my dear?\" she inquired. \"Do you\nknow Glasgow at all?\"\n\n\"I've never been here before, but I expect I can find diggings easily\nenough. Rehearsals begin to-morrow, don't they?\"\n\n\"Well, that was what we expected,\" responded Mr. Punter. \"But a few of\nthe principals have not arrived yet. Still, a short delay will enable\nyou to become word-perfect in your part, won't it? And that is so\nimportant.\"\n\n\"Yes-s. But when does the tour open, then?\"\n\n\"Of course that depends entirely on how the rehearsals progress. Now,\nyou must have something to eat before you start house-hunting. You won't\nmind going into the kitchen?\"\n\nMrs. Punter slouched on ahead, and Evarne followed to another room at\nthe rear of the house. This also was practically devoid of furniture,\nbut doubtless derived its name from the small oil-stove that stood on\nthe table.\n\nThe window looked out on to what had formerly been a garden, but which\nnow wore that melancholy and desolate aspect that characterises a once\nwell-tended spot that has long been utterly neglected. The lawn was a\nfield; the flower-beds lost in weeds; the gravel walks overgrown;\nboisterous winds had snapped the slender stem of a young tree, which now\nlay wilted upon the ground. Altogether, it was a scene in no way\nconducive to high spirits.\n\nThe authoress set about performing culinary operations with a frying-pan\nand the oil-stove, and in due course a repast was evolved of fried ham\nand stale bread. Evarne found Mrs. Punter's skill at cookery on a par\nwith the estimate she had already formed of her literary gifts. Eating\nheroically what she could, she rose to leave.\n\n\"But first I must introduce you to Charles Stuart,\" declared Mr. Punter,\nwho had joined them.\n\n\"Yes. Who is he?\"\n\n\"He does a little carpentering, and is to appear in the drama. He is now\npainting the scenery.\"\n\n\"Useful man,\" thought the girl, and almost forgave him for adopting such\na _nom-de-th\u00e9atre_.\n\nWending their way to a tiny outhouse, they there found this valuable\npersonage busily occupied in mixing paint. He turned round at their\nentry, and for the second time that hour Evarne with difficulty\nsuppressed a gasp. The entire person of Charles Stuart, as far as could\nbe seen, was so covered with black hair that at first glance he\nresembled a monkey. Quantities of fringe concealed his forehead, falling\neven over his massive eyebrows. Although quite young still, he not only\nhad a heavy moustache, but a beard and whiskers that lost themselves in\nthe thick mop covering his cranium, while his open shirt displayed a\nchest like unto a doormat. As he transferred the dripping paint-brush to\nhis left hand and advanced towards Evarne with his hairy right arm\noutstretched, the girl felt rather like ignobly bolting away. What very\nextraordinary people she had fallen amidst, to be sure!\n\nBut she stood her ground, and spoke to the man as if he had been a\nnatural-looking human being.\n\n\"What are you painting now, Mr. Stuart? I should like to see what you\nhave done, if I may.\"\n\n\"Show Miss Stornway what you are working at, Charlie,\" suggested Mr.\nPunter, and as they all went out into the garden he explained--\n\n\"Stuart was for years the head scene-painter at one of the leading\nLondon theatres. You see, we mean to spare no expense.\"\n\nEvarne found herself wishing that she had not been apparently the one\nexception in this determination concerning lavish expenditure.\n\nHanging against the wall of the house were three scenes--one a cottage\ninterior, another a wild glen, and the third, a rustic landscape,\nscarcely commenced.\n\n\"I should like to watch you work,\" she said. \"I paint a little myself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would like to help, then?\" Mr. Punter promptly suggested.\n\"All my sons work under Charlie. Come to-morrow, and we will find you an\napron and brushes and see what you can manage to produce, eh?\"\n\nLaughingly, Evarne promised, and at length was allowed to depart.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\n\n                        NEW TRIALS AND TROUBLES\n\n\nAfter some search she lighted on a really pleasant room, clean and\nbright, at a rent of ten shillings weekly. It possessed a true Scotch\nbed, built into a cupboard in the wall. She had her box conveyed from\nthe station, and that night slept comfortably enough in this curiously\nsituated bed, in which confused dreams of authoresses who inhabited\nruins, and hairy men who painted scenery in back gardens, appeared only\nan appropriate accompaniment.\n\nThe next afternoon she wended her way to Sauchiehall Street, and there\nmade the acquaintance of Mr. Punter's six sons, old and young--including\nPat, the youth who had first greeted her from the window. Then started\nscene-painting. She undertook to do a cottage window, draped with snowy\nmuslin curtains. Pots of scarlet geraniums stood on the sill, a big\nflour-bin was underneath, while a green pasture with a lovely blue sky\nshowed through the open lattice. Her effort evoked ardent admiration\nfrom the whole assembled Punter family. Indeed, Mrs. Punter's gratitude\nwas such that she impulsively invited the artist in to tea.\n\nNever had Evarne beheld such an extraordinary chamber as that upstairs\none into which--as a guest of the family--she was now admitted. The\nfirst impression was of the wildest confusion--house-moving, or\nspring-cleaning at least. Here, as elsewhere throughout the house, the\nwindows were cracked and broken. In one corner was a huge bed, covered\nwith a grimy patchwork quilt. Boxes stood around, some with open lids,\nothers as yet uncorded, while two large empty crates placed side by side\nand covered with a cloth formed the table. There were several chairs and\nstools, piles of dishes, cups and saucers of varied hues and designs;\nsome torn books, devoid of covers; a number of men's hats and outdoor\ncoats; and a baby's cradle half-filled with potatoes.\n\nThe uncarpeted floor, on which lay a few small rugs, was decorated\nlikewise by a considerable number of stage \"properties\" of many\ndescriptions. The half-dozen large plaster statues that stood around\ndoubtless came under this heading, but being all nude, they appeared\nindecently incongruous amidst this domestic confusion and makeshift.\nEvarne was now quite convinced that the Punters were merely\n\"squatters\"--that they paid no rent, that no public authority knew them\nto be here, that they had, in fact, taken up their temporary abode in\nwhat was really a deserted and supposedly uninhabitable house.\n\n\"I've been grieving all the night that you've not been engaged to play\n'Highland Mary,'\" commenced Mrs. Punter, after supplying her guest with\ntea. \"You're so verra bonnie, just like what I imagine her.\"\n\nEvarne was somewhat flattered.\n\n\"Will you care to hear 'Mary's' part?\" asked Mr. Punter, and he then\nread aloud those scenes in which this damsel appeared. Since she\nbreathed her last in the second act, and \"Clarinda\" then took her place\nas heroine, the _r\u00f4le_ was but brief.\n\n\"Now read her the part of 'Jean Armour,'\" said Mrs. Punter, and the\nobedient husband started off again.\n\nAs he ceased, he looked inquiringly at Evarne over the top of his\nspectacles.\n\nThe girl's genuine opinion was that never had she listened to such utter\ntwaddle in all her life. There did not seem to be any plot at all, no\nvestige of even a central thread of continuous story. Yet more and more\nwas proudly read aloud, until at length nearly the whole manuscript had\nbeen gone through. It was really immensely funny, but, alas! this was\nquite unintentional. Its creator laboured under the belief that she had\nproduced a poetical drama in blank verse, slightly bordering on a\ntragedy!\n\nEvarne felt cold depression steal over her as she listened. Was it\npossible that such inane dulness would ever attract the public? But,\nconcealing her fears, she inquired in respectful tones--\n\n\"Did it not take you a long time to write it?\"\n\n\"Oh dear me, no,\" was Mrs. Punter's lightly spoken disclaimer. \"I just\ndictated it to my husband in odd moments, while I'd be bustling about\ngetting dinner. It was no trouble to me, I assure you.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of the girl's tongue to answer, \"I thought not,\" but\ninstinct whispered that such a supposition might not fall quite prettily\nupon the authoress's ears. Instead, she was just hypocrite enough to\nlook as impressed as she could have done had Shakespeare himself stated\na similar fact.\n\nAfter this she rose to leave. Amiably enough they insisted on lending\nher several books concerning the hero of their drama; a volume of his\npoems, one called \"Burns's Highland Mary,\" another entitled \"Burns's\nChloris,\" and yet another about his \"Clarinda.\" Evarne thought it very\nunromantic and unpoetical of \"Bobbie\" to have worshipped at the shrines\nof so many \"ladye-loves,\" but was well pleased to be supplied with so\nmuch reading matter.\n\nStill, while all this was very well in its way, it was not business!\nDays passed. Mr. Sandy and \"Highland Mary\" did not arrive, neither did\nEvarne see any of her other fellow-artistes. As time went on and no\nrehearsal-call was given, while the demands upon her purse were\nconstant, she commenced to make frequent and anxious inquiries.\n\nMr. Punter was evidently as much concerned as she was herself.\n\n\"But it's no use my gathering the company together here until Mr. Sandy\nhas arrived. You must see that for yourself. The whole play circles\nround him, as you know. We must all wait a day or two longer. I admit I\ncannot account for his unexplained neglect, and am much displeased.\"\n\nEvarne saw nothing for it but to be patient and make the best of a bad\njob, but it was indeed a very seriously bad job in her case. She had\nbeen prepared to find it difficult to make her money last out until she\nreceived her first week's salary, and this delay over even commencing\nthe rehearsals was really terrible.\n\nShe was lonely as well as anxious. She recommenced sketching, studied\nBurns and his poems, stared in the shop-windows, visited the Corporation\nPicture Gallery, read in the Free Library. Despite all this, time hung\nheavily on her hands.\n\n\"What do the remainder of your company do?\" she inquired of Mr. Punter\none morning, on being informed, as usual, that no news had been heard of\nMr. Sandy. She had that hour been forced to produce another\nhalf-sovereign for her lodgings, and was seriously alarmed at her\nsituation. \"Are the others submitting to be kept fooling around earning\nnothing and having to spend money every day, as I am?\"\n\n\"They realise that it's no fault of mine, Miss Stornway,\" answered Mr.\nPunter severely, \"and they do not add to my worries by reproaching me,\neven indirectly.\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" retorted Evarne tartly. \"You say most of them\nhave homes in Glasgow. In that case it's not the same expense for them\nthat it is to me, and they have their friends and families also, while\nI'm alone.\"\n\n\"As far as that goes, I'll tell you what I can do--yes, and I will do\nit.\"\n\nThis was stated with such an imposing and benevolent air that Evarne\nwaited expectant to hear in what manner she was to be recompensed for\nthis unjustifiable delay.\n\n\"Yes, I can quite do away with any trouble of that nature. I shall give\nyour address in Shamrock Street to the very next of our lady artistes\nwho calls here, and she will doubtless come to see you. It is really too\nbad that you should have no society.\"\n\n\"It's decidedly worse that I should have no work, and, consequently no\nsalary,\" retorted the girl as she turned away.\n\nThe manager remembered his promise, for a couple of days later Evarne's\nlandlady announced that Miss Kennedy had called from Mr. Punter.\n\n\"Oh, show her in, and make tea for two, please,\" said the girl, and a\nminute later the visitor entered.\n\nShe was a slender little creature, barely eighteen years of age. In\nappearance she was one of those who seem to have been manufactured in\nwholesale batches. Her figure was practically identical with that of\nthousands of other girls, and her countenance likewise had very little\nthat was at all distinctive. The grey eyes were--well, they were what\nMiss Kennedy looked around the world with, nothing more nor less! All\nher other features were equally nondescript. Her light hair, much\nfrizzled in front and tied in a catagon behind, was neither dark nor\nfair, neither thin nor ample. The little face was not unattractive, but\npromised very average intelligence and no force of character. She bore\nnot the least likeness to the popular conception of an actress. Her face\nwas entirely free from the least artificial aid to beauty, while her\nplain serge coat and skirt, scarlet tam-o'-shanter and black cotton\ngloves were equally unpretentious.\n\nAs far as appearance went, she was in every way a contrast to beautiful,\nstately Evarne, with her aristocratic bearing, yet there was already a\nbond of sympathy between the two girls, and in less than five minutes\nthey were forming a kind of duet to complain of the perfidious behaviour\nof the Punters.\n\n\"It's really perfectly scandalous,\" declared Jessie Kennedy. \"They\npromised me the rehearsals were to begin ten days ago. They've got no\nright to get their company together--or almost together--like this,\nuntil they were really going to make a start. And to bring you all the\nway down from London too! I suppose they paid your fare?\"\n\n\"Yes, they did that, or I couldn't have come. Still, it's a great shame.\nThey must know people generally can't afford to live in idleness like\nthis. Yet what can we do?\"\n\n\"Well, I shall accept another engagement in a couple of days if they\ndon't begin, and so I shall tell them.\"\n\n\"What part have you got?\"\n\n\"I understudy you, I believe, but otherwise I'm not actually in the play\nitself. I'm the pianist. Of course, we're only a 'fit-up,' and don't\nhave an orchestra, but I'm at the piano all the time between the acts,\nand I play soft music during the love scenes, the death-beds, and the\nvisions.\"\n\n\"Then I should fancy you're kept very busy?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is plenty for me to do, but I don't mind that. I only want\nto start and do it.\"\n\n\"I wonder how the remainder of the company is taking this miserable\nidleness? Do you know any of them?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; nearly all, more or less. One, Harry Douglas, lives in my\nstreet, and he and I have done double turns at music halls. He's got a\nvoice like a seraph. He's the most glorious tenor you ever heard. He's\nlimes-man in this company.\"\n\n\"Do we have limelight, then?\"\n\n\"Rather, where 'Highland Mary' appears as a vision, and one or two other\nplaces.\"\n\n\"And what does Mr. Douglas think of it all?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter so much to him. He's working in a carpenter's shop\nuntil we start.\"\n\n\"Fancy! Can't he do a lot of things!\"\n\n\"But you should just hear him sing. Oh, my! It's angels! It is really!\"\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XIX\n\n                              NEW FRIENDS\n\n\nJessie Kennedy turned out to be a very companionable little person, and\nafter this first interview the two girls spent a good deal of time with\neach other.\n\nBut the question of funds was of infinitely greater consequence than any\nsocial intercourse, and with alarming rapidity Evarne had arrived at the\npoint when her resources were no longer represented by even the smallest\ngold coin of the realm. This thoroughly aroused her, and the very next\ntime she was again put off by excuses, her usual gentleness was swept\naway beneath one of those torrents of hot wrath that were a heritage\nfrom her mother. Her beautiful dark eyes seemed to positively flash fire\nas she fiercely declared that this sort of thing would have to stop,\nthat Mr. Punter's action in offering her this mock engagement, and so\npreventing her from seeking genuine work, was absolutely unjustifiable\nand infamous; that it was not far short, if at all, from cheating and\ndefrauding! She concluded by hotly stating that if Mr. Sandy could not\nor would not come, his part, in mere justice to others, ought to be\ngiven at once to an actor who would take it. She finished up by the\nstatement that she was voicing the opinion of others besides her own.\n\nThese words did not fall on barren ground. Mr. Punter definitely settled\non the evening of the following day for the long-deferred first\nrehearsal, and further announced that Mr. Sandy had now finally lost his\nsplendid chance, for Pat should go out immediately and telegraph for Mr.\nHeathmore, an even better actor, whom he knew to be anxiously longing\nfor the opportunity of appearing in \"Caledonia's Bard.\"\n\nOn the strength of all this Evarne allowed herself to be pacified, and\nwas amiably willing to admit that perhaps the real blame rested with the\nfaithless Mr. Sandy alone. Hereupon Mr. Punter had a suggestion to make.\n\n\"My wife and I have been talking the matter over, and we have decided to\noffer you--you, Miss Stornway--the _r\u00f4le_ of 'Highland Mary' in place of\nthat of 'Bess.' It is not a very long part, and you'll soon learn it.\nYour remuneration then would be twenty-three and six in place of a\nguinea. There now! Does not the notion appeal to you?\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" replied the girl dubiously. \"If you could have told me\nsooner than the very day before the rehearsals are at length to\nstart--but there, if you give me the script at once, I'll commence to\nstudy it. But what about costumes?\"\n\n\"Quite simple! Mrs. Punter herself has resolved to undertake the _r\u00f4le_\nof 'Jean Armour,' so she will buy one of your dresses for the purpose.\nShe says the blue cotton you showed her will serve nicely for you to\nwear when you go to meet 'Burns' in the glen, and with the money she\ngives you for the other you can buy some white stuff and make a robe\nthat will do to die in, and likewise for the vision.\"\n\n\"I agree then, willingly. Who is to play 'Bess'?\"\n\n\"We see no reason why Miss Kennedy should not undertake that inferior\npart. Madame Cheape--our 'Clarinda,' you remember--will arrive in a day\nor so, thus all the female _r\u00f4les_ will be most satisfactorily filled.\"\n\nAs Evarne walked back to Shamrock Street, she thought somewhat ruefully\nthat she had fallen among a very queer and reckless--not to say\nshady--set of people. Everything connected with them and their\nenterprise seemed a matter of makeshifts. She could not help smiling to\nrecall the grandiose announcements printed at the head of the official\nnotepaper. \"Company of Star Artistes,\" indeed! Fancy herself, then,\nnever having yet set foot upon the boards or spoken one word in public,\nbeing created leading lady amid these universal stars! Still, it was\nsuch a silly soft part in such a silly soft play she had to act, that\nshe was troubled by no apprehensions as to whether she was sufficiently\npowerful, or emotional, or capable, or anything else. She was fully\nconvinced of her ability to rise to equal heights with the other\nstars--at all events as far as those constellations, Mrs. Punter and\nJessie, were concerned.\n\nThe following evening, sure enough, rehearsals of a sort did indeed\ncommence. Mr. Heathmore was not forthcoming, and \"Caledonia's Bard\"\nwithout \"Bobbie\" was even worse than \"Hamlet\" without the \"Prince of\nDenmark.\" Still, it was a comfort to make a start of any sort.\n\nJessie Kennedy at once brought up Harry Douglas, and presented him to\nMiss Stornway. He was undertaking two minor _r\u00f4les_ in addition to\nmanaging the limelight and helping to shift scenery, and within the\nfirst five minutes' conversation this all-round genius had incidentally\nremarked that for several years he had been a professional lightweight\nprize-fighter.\n\nTwo men--besides the ubiquitous \"Bobbie\"--had dialogue parts with\nEvarne.\n\nJoe Harold--who played her stage father--she had heard much of already.\nJessie had procured him this engagement, and had confided to her new\nfriend that ere the tour ended she hoped to have brought to pass another\nengagement of a more romantic and lasting type. He was absolutely the\ndearest boy alive, she declared. He was a Jew, his real name being Joe\nMoses, but no one would ever guess it. He hadn't got a hook nose, and he\nwould share his last penny with a pal. He had only one failing in the\nworld, sometimes he took a \"wee drappie\" too much to drink, but she\nwould help him to conquer that weakness. He was a commercial traveller,\nbut, being out of a job, had been pleased to join her in \"Caledonia's\nBard.\"\n\nJohn Montgomery--the stage doctor who had to aid \"Bess\" to persuade\n\"Mary\" to die respectably in bed--had great pretensions to good looks;\nmoreover, he was both tall and stalwart. But he was no more a\nprofessional actor than the remainder of the company--as a rule he\nearned his bread as a compositor.\n\nThere was, indeed, one taller than Montgomery, one whose height numbered\ntwo or three inches over six feet, but who paid for longitude by a\npainful meagreness. Archie--for so Jessie called him--was, in very\nsooth, a protracted tragedy. The son of a groom, he had been, until the\nage of fifteen or thereabouts, the tiniest, lightest little chap\nimaginable. Always amid horses, his one ambition was to become a jockey,\nand he might have succeeded in attaining this aspiration, had not cruel\nNature taken it into her head to make him grow! He had sprouted almost\nvisibly, beneath the horrified eyes of his horsey friends, and ere he\ncame to eighteen years had reached the proud--yet hated--height of six\nfeet three. Poor Archie's ambition being thus hopelessly blighted, he\nhad made no effort to settle to any less fascinating career, but earned\nhis daily bread by doing more or less badly whatever came next to hand.\n\nOf such consisted the \"star company\"! Evarne deemed them all quite\nsuitable individuals to be thus secretly conglomerated in an empty room\nof a deserted house hidden away behind a hoarding and seemingly\nforgotten in the very heart of Glasgow. Strange fate that had brought\nher to form one of the conspiracy!\n\nThe rehearsals now proceeded daily, Mr. Punter always giving the cues of\n\"Burns's\" and \"Clarinda's\" parts. The chief difficulty lay in\nremembering \"who was whom\" at any given moment. Without exception, all\nthe men played a couple of characters, in some cases even three separate\nand distinct _r\u00f4les_. Mad-looking Charles Stuart appeared as a prince\nand as \"Clarinda's\" footman--a proceeding that appeared to Evarne as the\nheight of absurdity. Charlie swore he had no intention of visiting the\nbarber, and no one, having once seen that weird head above royal robes,\ncould possibly fail to recognise it again, even though the appended body\nmight, next time, chance to be clad in servant's livery. They would at\nonce discern the prince in disguise in \"Clarinda's\" establishment, and\nwould accordingly look for intricacies of plot--doomed to be\ndisappointed.\n\nIf it had not all been really a matter of such serious consequence to\nher, the girl would have spent her time during these rehearsals in\nstruggling with inopportune laughter. As it was, her expression grew\nhabitually more and more serious as the conviction forced itself like\nunto a barbed arrow into her brain: \"This play is to fail! It is bound\nto fail! It can never succeed, never; and what can I do then?\"\n\nFor the present, at all events, there was neither inaction nor\nloneliness. She made the more intimate acquaintance of Joe Harold and\nJohn Montgomery by inviting them, together with Jess, to her lodging one\nevening for a little private rehearsal of the death-bed scene. To her\namusement the men had purchased sausage-rolls, cakes and ginger-beer\nfrom the shop round the corner, and the business over, they produced\nthese edibles and invited themselves and their hostess to supper.\n\nThe unappetising topic that opened the meal was the universal poverty\nthat prevailed. All had been out of work for some time, it appeared,\nand, like Evarne, were subsisting painfully on a few paltry and\nfast-failing savings, until the first week's salary from Mr. Punter\nshould arrive to relieve the situation.\n\nIt was the second time in her short career that Evarne had been\nintroduced into an absolutely fresh world. Live and learn! Had the girl\ngiven her opinion a month ago, it would probably have been to the effect\nthat all commercial travellers, compositors, and daughters of\nscene-shifters (for this Jess owned had been her father's avocation in\nlife) were necessarily common and uneducated--even though worthy enough\nfolk. But there was very little either in the speech or ways of her\nthree humble friends that could have appeared either absurd or offensive\nto the most dainty lady in the land, while Mont, the printer, was\nremarkably well-informed, handsome, and interesting. Thus for so long,\nat all events, as Evarne and her commercial traveller and her printer\nhad mutual interests in \"Caledonia's Bard,\" she found them infinitely\nmore congenial than had been the majority of those men in the higher\nwalks of life whom Morris had presented to her.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the nature of the society by which she had been\nsurrounded in those bygone days had, from first to last, presented\nitself as one of the drawbacks of her unfortunate position. Time's\nprogress had, to some considerable extent, blunted the keenness of her\nsusceptibilities in this direction. Still, she now found it passing\nsweet to receive once again that vague indescribable deference and\nrespect that distinguishes so subtly--perchance so unconsciously--a\nman's manner towards a \"good\" woman, from that which he assumes to one\nwhose morals are understood to be \"easy.\"\n\nYet more strongly did she experience a similar charm in the society of\nJessie. The young girl--\"who would sooner marry Joe with all his faults\nand without a penny, because she truly loved him, than marry a lord she\ndidn't care for\"--might not have been as witty, as merry, as brightly\namusing as some other women whom Evarne could have named, but she was\nthe first self-respecting and respectable member of her own age and\nsex--save Margaret--whom the girl had known since she left\nHeatherington.\n\nThose years given to Morris--however brightened and redeemed by her\npouring forth the most disinterested and sweetest affection--had been\nreally very lonely--very desolate. When she had first been thrown into\ncontact with the female associates that Morris's men friends had been\nwilling to introduce to her, she had instinctively disliked and shrank\nfrom them, even although she had been far too childishly innocent at\nfirst to realise to the full the depravity of these \"kept\" women.\n\nEven in the days of her na\u00efve ignorance of the real nature of their\npurchased love--when the consciousness of her own high impulses,\ncombined with the all-embracing instinct of charity in her disposition,\nhad led her to attribute only her own really beautiful motives and\nemotions to these other women, who led lives outwardly corresponding to\nher own--she, and they likewise, had felt that there was really nothing\nin common between them. They belonged to different worlds.\n\nAnd even now, between Evarne and her lowly Scotch friends--honest and\nagreeable though they might be--there was still a barrier, that of\ncaste, culture, habit. It might be totally disregarded amongst them by\ncommon consent, but was not thus easily annihilated. They were of an\nentirely different station--of another stamp--from the daughter of the\nrefined Oxford student, with his lengthy pedigree and old traditions.\nThey and their equals could never have entered thus intimately into her\ndaily life had she not been _d\u00e9class\u00e9e_. In one way or another, Evarne\nwas indeed cut off from all open companionship with those men--and\nespecially those women--who would have been really suited to one\npossessed of her training, her general refinement, her personal\ncharacter and nature. Had her few brief years of love's happiness\nforedoomed her to lead for evermore the lonely life? Was it partly this\nthat was foreboded in the grim smile of Sekhet?\n\nBut as comrades the four amalgamated splendidly, and at length the date\non which the tour was to really start was actually settled. Mr.\nHeathmore and Madame Cheape were going direct from their homes to Ayr,\nsince \"Bobbie's\" birthplace was to have the honour of witnessing the\nfirst performance of \"Caledonia's Bard.\" The other members of the\ncompany were to leave Glasgow on Monday, rehearse with \"Bobbie\" for the\nfirst time that same evening, and open on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XX\n\n                               REHEARSALS\n\n\nBut before then Evarne was reduced to what was indeed a harrowing\nnecessity--a surreptitious visit to the pawnshop. For some days ere this\nshe had been gradually eating less and less in a despairing endeavour to\nhinder the steady lightening of her purse. But even porridge and tea,\nbread and salt butter, rice and brown sugar, however cheap, and alas!\ncorrespondingly nasty, cost something.\n\nOne terrible morning, on returning from the day's meagre shopping, she\nsat down to grapple with the fact that all the money she possessed\namounted to five pennies and one farthing.\n\nThe only article of any value that she still owned was her simple little\nenamel-cased watch.\n\nThe dire necessity of creeping into a pawnshop, to raise money on her\nfather's last gift, distressed the girl beyond measure. She sat playing\nwith the poor little thing, turning it over and over tenderly in her\nhands, while tears of mingled shame and grief gathered behind her\neyelids. At length she was learning the truly humiliating side of abject\npoverty. She had asked Mr. Punter to advance a portion of her first\nweek's salary, and had been refused. Now, not only was she terrified and\nappalled as she heard the violent scratching of the gaunt wolf against\nher slender shaking door, but abashed and mortified at what must be done\nto ward off these cruel fangs yet a little longer.\n\nHowever, she talked logic and practical common sense to herself, and\nafter twilight had shrouded the city in a kindly veil, sought out an\nestablishment decorated by three balls, and as unobtrusively as possible\nsneaked inside its portals.\n\nAn old man behind the counter of the small cubby-hole in which she found\nherself, looked at her watch and inquired how much she wanted on it? She\nhad half anticipated being called upon to prove that it was legally\nhers, but questions of any other nature were quite unexpected. On the\nspur of the moment, fearful of asking too much, she said softly,\n\"Twenty-five shillings, please.\" But even at this the old man pouted out\nhis lips for a minute, then said:\n\n\"We couldna gie ye mair nor fifteen shillin's.\"\n\nWith the colour rising to her cheeks Evarne agreed, whereupon her\nembarrassment was increased by the unlooked-for fact of her name being\ndemanded. With a half-sovereign and five shillings in her purse, and her\nwatch represented by a horrible pawn-ticket, she slipped from the shop,\nfeeling relieved and degraded at the same time.\n\nShe clung to the idea of the ultimate success of \"Caledonia's Bard\" with\na tenacity that was pitiful. It must, it should triumph! She dared not\nlook onward and contemplate what might be her lot if this unpromising\nventure should indeed fail. The future had seemed black enough while she\nstill possessed a few pounds and one or two trinkets. Now she had\nnothing--nothing!\n\nOn the company arriving at Ayr on Monday afternoon they proceeded direct\nto the Drill Hall, where the \"fit-up\" was to be erected. There--to the\nfrank surprise of some of the more incredulous--they actually discovered\nboth Mr. Heathmore and Madame Cheape awaiting them. The parts of \"Burns\"\nand \"Clarinda\" were not, then, to be undertaken at the last moment by\nMr. Punter and Evarne respectively, as had been whispered.\n\nThe girls were scarcely prepossessed by Madame Cheape. Evidently quite a\nmiddle-aged woman, she obviously objected to this fact being known, and\nstrove to conceal it by the use of golden hair-dye and face powder, of\nwhich quantity endeavoured to compensate for quality. This very\nforgivable weakness in the lady's nature could have been overlooked, but\nher affected airs and languid drawl were, somehow, irritating in the\nlast degree.\n\nShe inquired if Evarne and Jess were settled in \"diggings\" yet, and\nsuggested that all three should put up together. The girls glanced\nquestioningly at one another. They had already arranged to divide\nexpenses, and now, on the score of further economy, agreed to the\nnewcomer's proposition.\n\nAnd certainly, it was largely the business-like capacities of Madame\nCheape that enabled them to get rooms for twelve-and-six the week for\nthe three. For this sum they were to have a sitting-room on the ground\nfloor, a double-bedded front and a small back bedroom upstairs. By\ncommon consent Madame Cheape was accorded the privilege of solitary\ngrandeur.\n\nThe house stood in an eminently respectable street, one end of which\nopened on to the banks of a canal. The sitting-room was really quite\npretty, with clean curtains, pictures, and cheerful  cushions.\nMoreover, in the corner stood a piano, its brightly-polished\ncandle-holders and embroidered key-cover suggesting that it was the\npride of its owner's heart.\n\nThat evening took place what had promised to be the first real\nrehearsal, but lo! it seemed totally impossible to get a full cast\ntogether. \"Clarinda\" and \"Burns\" were on hand now, sure enough, but that\nmuch-needed personage, Charles Stuart--scene painter and shifter--prince\nand footman--had run away! He added insult to injury by leaving a\nmessage that he was \"safely out of it,\" and \"Caledonia's Bard\" knew him\nno more.\n\nHis mantle descended upon two of Mr. Punter's sons, who donned it\nreluctantly enough. These lads, Pat and Billie, nervous gawks of\nseventeen and nineteen, were both seemingly of such timorous\ndispositions as to be unable to speak above a whisper. The lost Charlie\nhad roared his words like the Bull of Bashan. He would have been\naudible, at all events.\n\nMr. Heathmore repeatedly assured everyone that he had only received his\nscript that Saturday. Since some of the scenes consisted almost entirely\nof soliloquies on Burns's part, and since the poet, even in casual\nconversation, had a little way of giving utterance to speeches of over a\npage in length, poor Mr. Heathmore was still far from having committed\nthe part to memory. He unblushingly carried the voluminous script in his\nhand as he acted, but held out hopes of knowing it pretty well by the\nfateful Wednesday night. But if he really believed this himself, no one\nelse shared his confidence on the point.\n\nEven had the performance been a fortnight instead of a couple of days\nahead, the company would have appeared in a hopelessly backward and\nmuddled state. Dismay was universal.\n\n\"This is no ordinary theatrical concern, is it?\" inquired Evarne\ndespondently, and thereby aroused a regular storm.\n\n\"Heavens, no! It's a howling swindle! Ayr will probably see the\nbeginning and the end of the whole idiotic show.\" All agreed that the\nplay itself was a bit of rubbish, the management a regular humbugging\naffair, and the prospects of the tour--nil!\n\n\"Do let's work hard, though. Do let's make it a success if we can,\"\nbegged poor Evarne, but indeed no one stood in need of any such\nprompting. All would willingly have rehearsed from morning to night, but\nMr. Heathmore insisted on being left in peace on Tuesday afternoon to\ntry to master at least some of his endless part. Thus the remainder of\nthe company were at liberty to visit Burns's Cottage, the Kirk o'\nAlloway, and to wander along \"Ye banks and braes o' Bonnie Doon.\"\n\nIn the evening, after another rehearsal, the girls held a reception\nand supper-party in their sitting-room. It was not a wild\nextravagance--indeed rather an economy--though maybe there was something\nof \"eat, drink and be merry, for to-morrow we die,\" in the feeling that\nprompted it. The supper was a joint-stock affair; everyone who was\ninvited was in the same breath likewise asked to produce fourpence\ntowards the banquet. Jess expended the fund of three shillings thus\nraised on bread and cheese, honest unpretentious beer, a monstrous hot\nrice pudding with jam sauce, mixed biscuits and a couple of bunches of\nwatercress. All the shareholders were fully satisfied, and united in a\nvote of thanks to the caterer.\n\nAfter supper an impromptu concert was organised. Everyone was able to\ncontribute to the general entertainment, save Evarne herself, and Pat\nand Billie Punter, whom nobody heeded. But Evarne fulfilled her share of\nsocial duties by presiding over all, and surely never had such a\ngracious and tactful young hostess held sway over such a strangely mixed\ngathering.\n\nThe piano--the well-tuned, well-polished piano--was an immense\nassistance. Mont sang, Jessie played, and Douglas was enabled to show\noff his much-belauded tenor notes. And exquisite they were, in\nsooth--those tender, heart-stirring and dulcet strains. It was indeed a\nglorious singing-bird that was confined in this ex-prize fighter's\nthroat.\n\nThe hostess's only trouble was Madame Cheape. That languid individual\nhad spent the afternoon with the landlady, Mrs. Sargeant, and the\nevening likewise, presumably, for she had not turned up at the seven\no'clock rehearsal.\n\nAnd alack! this protracted confabulation had very evidently not\nbeen carried on without the aid of a certain amount of liquid\nrefreshment--and that, too, of a more exhilarating nature than mere tea.\nThus, after a bumper of beer at supper, the sentiment of the tenor's\nlove-songs proved too trying. The final strains of \"Sweet G\u00e9nevi\u00e8ve\"\nwere still lingering on the air, when the hush that Douglas's enchanted\nnotes evoked was ruthlessly broken in upon by Madame Cheape. She\nproclaimed that they were all getting \"a confounded sight too solemn,\"\nand that she would liven them up with a dance. Thereupon the poor old\nthing, seizing her skirts, proceeded to \"liven them up a bit.\"\n\nJess, who was seated at the piano, promptly strummed a merry dance-tune,\nand all laughed to watch Madame Cheape's absurd caperings. There had\nbeen a time when Evarne would immediately have been outraged by the\npainful spectacle, but now, to behold a half-drunken woman providing\nmerriment for a roomful of men was no longer strange or instantly\nrepulsive. She laughed too, until she suddenly realised that she had\nbeen enabled to discover that Madame Cheape wore red garters, and\nremembered that she was in the society of presumably respectable men.\n\nShe became scandalised, and, springing to her feet, called, to Jess to\ncease playing at once. Then, since the dancing was continued with\nrenewed vigour to compensate for the absence of music, Evarne laid her\nhands on the shoulders of the skittish performer, and suggested that\n\"Clarinda\" should retire and have a nice long night in readiness for the\nmorrow. But dear \"Clarinda,\" not being taken by this notion, declined to\nact upon it. She hadn't nearly done her dance yet. Let Miss Stornway be\noff to bed herself. But Evarne was determined to get the intoxicated\nwoman out of the room, and rapidly crossing to the door, flung it open\nas a preliminary to bringing \"gentle strength\" to reinforce her wise\nadvice.\n\nOutside a surprise awaited Evarne.\n\nShe found herself face to face with the flabbergasted Mrs. Sargeant, who\nwas standing on the doormat.\n\n\"You were just coming in, I suppose?\" inquired Evarne politely.\n\nThe landlady stammered, and at length confessed that she had been\nlistening. But her explanation made the action appear forgivable--even\ntouching. Her son was a sailor, she said; he used to sing \"Sweet\nG\u00e9nevi\u00e8ve,\" and until this evening she had not heard it since he went\naway to sea.\n\nEvarne believed her, and was moved to sympathy.\n\n\"Would you very much like to hear it again?\" she asked. \"I'm sure Mr.\nDouglas won't mind repeating it.\"\n\nGratefully the woman entered the room and stood by the piano, her eyes\nfixed on the singer, as once more his exquisite notes sweetened the air.\nThen, full of thanks, she went out, taking the unsentimental Madame\nCheape with her, and ere long the party broke up.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXI\n\n                    THE CAREER OF \"CALEDONIA'S BARD\"\n\n\nAt length the feared and fateful Wednesday dawned. The morning was\ndevoted to a final rehearsal that only left everyone more confused--more\nhopeless--than ever. Not a solitary actor was word-perfect in all the\n_r\u00f4les_ that fell to his share. Evarne and Jess, with a single part\napiece, were the most promising, but both were absolutely inexperienced,\nand now rather frightened.\n\nIn the afternoon the actors erected the \"fit-up,\" under the supervision\nof Brown, the baggage-man, while the girls looked on and encouraged\ntheir struggles. Evarne, who had only that very morning been able to get\nthe money for her brown costume from Mrs. Punter, had spent it on white\nbutter-muslin for the \"vision\" gown. She now sat hastily stitching away\nat the interminable, seams of a flowing, snowy, shroud-like garment,\nwhilst Madame Cheape--sober again--poured into her presumably maiden ear\nlamentations concerning the woes of married life.\n\nBy the evening, the whole company was in a state of irritable\nnervousness and apprehension. They ate what tea they could--and in some\ncases that implied what they were able to get--and were all gathered in\nthe hall, with ample time not only to dress, but to stand around in\nknots, conversing in ominous whispers. Archie, the soured, even went so\nfar as to assert that they were all very likely to be lynched by an\ninfuriated public.\n\nIt was difficult to avoid some feelings of sympathy with poor old Mrs.\nPunter, as she handed each member of the company a leaf from some\nspecies of herb, which she confidently declared would bring them luck.\nShe also made it understood that she was going to celebrate the first\nnight by standing drinks all round, and solemnly wrote down on a slip of\npaper each individual's fancy in this direction.\n\nThis did something towards producing a more universally good-natured\nstate of mind, but the reaction was sudden and disgust loud and\nundisguised, when--after the elaborate ceremony of putting everyone's\nwishes into writing and duly receiving their thanks--all that did verily\nmake its appearance was one bottle of lemonade--small size!\n\nAnd the performance! A fiasco had been anticipated, but it proved to be\neven worse than the wildest nightmare had pictured. Evarne really did\nknow her part, and had rehearsed her dying scene with Mont and Jess\nuntil they presented it--or so they flattered themselves--in a manner\nthat would cause it to come as a refreshing little oasis in the midst of\nthe evening's confusion. But to rehearse in private and to appear in\npublic are two different matters. Jess repeatedly forgot her words, and\nwould then unblushingly demand in loud, flurried whispers, \"What's next,\nfor Heaven's sake?\" That was bad enough, but Mont was far worse. He not\nonly forgot his _r\u00f4le_ as completely as if he had never learned it, but\nseemingly every other word but one in the whole Scottish language\nlikewise.\n\nAt all events, what he did whenever wild glances from both girls told\nhim that he had got to say something or other, was to repeat over and\nover again a phrase that sounded like \"She's champing, she's champing.\"\nEvarne felt really angry at his stupidity in describing her as if she\nhad been a fretful mare instead of a dying maiden. Finally, it dawned on\nher perception that this imbecile doctor was holding out hope to the\nweeping friends around her couch--assuring them that the patient was\n\"champion\"!--Scotch for \"in excellent health.\" What a monstrous lack of\nresource on Mont's part, when he knew right well that the curtain\ndescended on the touching demise of this damsel whom he persisted in\ndescribing as \"champion\"!\n\nAs to poor \"Highland Mary\" herself, she was utterly tricked and sold.\nWhere were all the graceful gestures to the perfecting of which so much\npractice had been devoted? Where those truly dramatic attempts to spring\nfrom the bed with outstretched arms, as beauteous visions assailed her\ndying eyes? Where the pathetic leaning over to one side to gently stroke\nthe bent head of the weeping \"Bess\"? Where all those sweet and realistic\nlittle touches which were to have brought tears to the eyes of even a\nbored and irate audience? All impossible! Out of the question! Had\ninvestigation been made, the luckless \"Mary\" would have been found to be\nbreathing out her last sigh upon a couple of chairs laid over on their\nsides, with two tin bonnet-boxes between them to render this makeshift\ncouch sufficiently long.\n\nAs it was, her toes projected over the end of the lowest chair, while\nshe suffered such anguish from knobs and spikes that it composed a mild\nform of torture. Yet whenever she dared to so much as wriggle, the\ntin-boxes creaked loudly, while had she attempted to gain genuine relief\nby actually shifting from her first position--had she not lain\nabsolutely motionless, propped up on one elbow, which soon ached to\ndistraction--tragedy would have been turned to comedy with a vengeance.\nThose rickety chairs would assuredly have over-tipped, and the audience\nwould have beheld \"Mary\" and her improvised couch rolling pell-mell\ntogether down to the footlights.\n\nMr. Heathmore started by explaining to the audience that his part had\nbeen sent to him too late to be possibly learnt; then he undisguisedly\nproceeded to read it. In the \"glen scene\" Evarne found it truly\ndisconcerting to have to stand throughout these endless love-speeches,\nher waist tenderly encircled by \"Burns's\" arm sure enough, but with his\nhead all the time turned right away from her in order to gaze on the\nscript that he held in his other hand. As to the rest of the drama, she\nnever had been able to learn properly who was whom, or what they were\nall up to, and even the first public performance threw no light on the\npuzzle.\n\nThe play was proceeded with to the bitter end, but a mere sprinkling of\nspectators remained to the finish. Quite early in the evening the\nquieter members of the disgusted audience had, in severe silence, left\nthe hall. The more rowdy element remained to get what return they could\nfor their money by hooting, cat-calling, whistling and shouting.\n\nJess stuck to her post at the hired piano, and played away heroically\nthroughout the protracted intervals between the acts. The young girl was\nquite admirable, sitting alone amidst the defrauded audience, strumming\naway dauntlessly, regardless of the nutshells thrown at her, and the\njeers and ribald questions by which she was assailed.\n\nAll the performers at least were heartily thankful when the miserable\nshow was over for the night, and midst many \"swear words\" from the men\nand plaintive deep-breathed \"Sh's!\" from the girls, they wended their\nways to their respective lodgings.\n\nAnd next evening it all had to be gone through once more, and this time\nthe supply of audience was strictly limited. It might be owing to the\nrain, which was descending in a steady Scotch drizzle. But the\ndespondent mummers had a shrewd suspicion that the truth concerning \"P.\nPunter's Magnificent Co.\" had spread throughout the length and breadth\nof Ayr. It was not merely the dejection caused by the snub expressed by\nthe rows of empty benches that brought such frowns upon usually placid\nbrows. The abject poverty prevailing in the company was universal.\nSeveral of the young people were almost penniless, and made no secret of\ntheir destitute condition. So a deputation had waited upon the manager\nthat afternoon to \"protest,\" or \"kick up a righteous row,\" as they put\nit--to \"try to get the breeks off a Hielander,\" according to Mr.\nPunter's version. In plain words, there was a general demand that, in\nconsideration of the long delay for rehearsals, a portion of the\ncompany's salary should be now paid in advance--at least sufficient to\nbuy bread and cheese until the end of the week. After much argument,\nappeals, and threats, Mr. Punter had been brought to promise that the\ntakings on that evening should be divided amidst the company after the\nshow. Thus the tiny audience was a truly serious matter.\n\nThe second cause for anxious frownings was the statement of Archie that\nthe eldest Punter boy had been overheard to tell the girl behind the bar\nin the \"Ass and the Thistle,\" that the company was to be disbanded at\nthe close of the three days at Ayr. No hint of this had been officially\ngiven, but it seemed so highly probable that it was generally accepted\nfor fact. Evarne dared not contemplate it. The sorrows of the past\nseemed already years behind her, overlaid by the painful excitement and\ninterest of the present, and sick anxiety and apprehension concerning\nthe grey-shrouded future.\n\nA little innovation was introduced that evening that certainly made\nthings run smoother. Jess not only played in the intervals, but lifted\nup her voice and sang old familiar Scottish ballads. This was\nimmediately popular. The audience joined in the chorus of some, and\napplauded all. Jess sang until her throat must have ached, and was\nundoubtedly the success of the evening.\n\nAfter the \"rag\" had fallen for the last time, the audience dispersed\nhowling, booing and hissing, out into the rain. Then the company\ngathered expectant around Mr. Punter, who accordingly handed out some\ncoins. It was but small sums that he distributed, but it was something\nto go on with, and Evarne and Jessie came off far best of all with four\nshillings apiece.\n\nBy Friday morning the girls at least felt too abashed to willingly show\nthemselves in the streets of Ayr. But another rehearsal call had been\ngiven for eleven o'clock--which at least sounded encouraging--so\nexhorting one another to be defiant and brazen, they wended their way\ntowards the hall. As they neared it, Jess suddenly stood still, and\nclutched Evarne's arm. Three men had appeared from out the building,\nstaggering beneath the weight of a piano. This they placed on a cart,\ncarefully covered it with oil-skins, and drove away.\n\n\"Oh my! is that my piano gone?\" gasped the little songstress. Impossible\nthat their resource--their stand-by--should have been thus filched from\nthem! Yet so it was. The owner of the piano, it seemed, had been present\non the previous evening, and being perchance a prophet and able to\nforesee the future, had taken time by the forelock and demanded in\nadvance the money due for the hire of his instrument. A quarrel with Mr.\nPunter had resulted, which ended by the man ruthlessly removing his\npiano.\n\nJessie particularly was in a fine state of distress: with her it was a\ncase of \"Othello's occupation's gone,\" and her complaints and\nlamentations rang loud. \"Caledonia's Bard\" unrelieved by music!\nTerrible! At length, Heaven bestowed an inspiration upon the troubled\nJessie. What about Mrs. Sargeant's piano? Surely if Harry Douglas went\nand asked for its loan, making a personal favour of the matter, he might\nsucceed. If Mrs. Sargeant at first declined, and he forthwith broke out\ninto the strains of \"Sweet G\u00e9nevi\u00e8ve,\" would he not be irresistible?\nAnyway, for goodness' sake let it be tried.\n\nProcuring a trolley, and accompanied by Brown, the heroic Douglas set\nout upon this venture. In less than half an hour they returned. Wonder\nand delight! then efforts of the modern Orpheus had been crowned with\nsuccess. He had sung \"Sweet G\u00e9nevi\u00e8ve,\" and had thereby charmed either\nMrs. Sargeant or her piano. Here it was! he stood by it smiling--proud\nand happy singer!\n\nAll that day it poured with rain. It was now the evening of the last\nperformance of \"Caledonia's Bard\" at Ayr. What were Mr. Punter's\narrangements for the morrow? So far he had given no clue. The weather\nadded to the general depression; none ventured out into the downpour,\nbut as twilight fell the figures of the actors and actresses, huddled\nunder umbrellas, might be seen approaching the hall from various\ndirections.\n\nThe conjectures, the suggestions, the hopes, the fears discussed in the\ndressing-rooms were of far greater interest to the members of the\ncompany than was the play itself. The time they spent on the stage--far\nfrom appearing in the light of the most important moments of the\nevening--seemed but breaks into the far more serious and enthralling\n\"Drama of Reality\" in which all were taking part.\n\nIt was now a generally known secret that Mr. Punter was unable to pay\nthe nine pounds owing for the hire of the hall. Halfway through the\nevening it was further spread around--in mysterious murmurs and with\nbated breath--that the instant the curtain fell for the last time\neveryone must be prepared to look after themselves--their own\ninterests--and, as far as possible, those of Mr. Punter. All were to\npromptly seize on their respective belongings for fear they might be\nclaimed by the officials of the hall; the \"fit-up\" was to be rushed\ndown--on the morrow all were returning to Glasgow, where more prosperous\narrangements would be made for the future.\n\nBut this programme of events, even if originating in Mr. Punter's brain,\nwas not destined to enjoy his co-operation. Suddenly Joe startled the\ngirls by dashing almost without warning into their dressing-room.\n\n\"He's gone--he's off--the blaggard!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Who? Where?\"\n\n\"Why, that vile Punter. Somebody from the station has come and told\nBrown. Him and Mrs. Punter and the kids caught the five-to-ten to\nGlasgow. He was off with all the cash while we were finishing acting his\nrotten play! He's given us the slip, left us in the lurch without our\nsalary! Got clean away with all the rest of the takings, such as they\nare!\"\n\nBoth the girls gasped, and Evarne, homeless, friendless, with exactly\nfive-and-twopence in the world, turned pale. A moment later, a sudden\nuproar on the stage caused them to both rush out excitedly. There,\nsurrounded by irate actors and stage-hands, stood--or rather huddled\ntogether--Pat and Billie Punter.\n\n\"We've got them, anyway!\" shouted Brown. \"They'll have to pay something\nfor their pa!\"\n\nBefore any further threats could be either uttered or put into action,\ntwo men appeared in the entrance, closing dripping umbrellas, and with\ncountenances as lowering as the weather without. They were the\nrespective owners of the Drill Hall and of the hired piano. The latter\nstrode straight up the gangway to the Punters.\n\n\"Here, you young thieving varmints. Where's my money for the two\nevenings you had my piano? Five-and-six a night, and three shillings for\ntransport. I'll just thank you to hand over fourteen shillings.\"\n\n\"I'm afeared----\" Pat was commencing feebly.\n\n\"No jaw! Hand over my fourteen shillings,\" repeated the man.\n\nPat accordingly remained silent, and fumbled in his pocket. The\npiano-owner's brow cleared somewhat, but only to cloud afresh as the\nyouth merely produced his father's visiting-card.\n\n\"If you'll take this,\" faltered Pat, offering the piece of pasteboard.\n\n\"What! D'you think that's good enough! You and your visiting-card\nbe----\" the irate creditor was beginning, when the owner of the hall\ninterposed--\n\n\"Look here. I shall pay you this fourteen shillings out of my own\npocket, and for my security I will retain possession of everything now\nin the place. Do you all understand?\"--and he glanced sternly round at\nthe assembled company. \"You're at liberty to take yourselves off--the\nsooner the better--but if any of you attempt to remove any\nproperties--yes, I mean either stage-truck, or what you choose to call\nyour own--I will have in the police. Understand that now.\"\n\nHis listeners returned him no response, but unobtrusively wandered\noff to their respective dressing-rooms. Forewarned, everybody had\npractically completed their packing, and now the owner of the hall,\npenetrating behind the scenes, discovered the entire company to be\nfastening straps and hastily cramming various objects of one sort\nand another into pockets or blouses. Bags and boxes were vanishing\nwith various figures who were drifting away towards the front\nentrance--striving to render themselves as small and insignificant as\npossible--yet departing with all good speed. In an instant he had made\nup his mind. He whispered to one of his satellites, and in half a minute\nall the gas was turned off, plunging the whole place into inky\nblackness.\n\nEvarne was in the act of fastening the padlock to the end of the long\nmetal rod of her basket, when this darkness as of Erebus suddenly\ndescended. Finishing her task, she was groping her way between chairs\nand boxes to where she imagined the door to be, when she heard the\nwelcome sound of Mont's voice.\n\n\"Are you here, Miss Stornway?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite lost. What has happened?\"\n\n\"He's done it on purpose. Here, Brown, strike that match now. Quickly,\nwhich is your box? We will carry it out for you.\"\n\nThe last match they owned between them flared and died out, and in the\ndarkness the three groped their way from the hall. Evarne went ahead and\ntried to clear the track as best she could, but all stumbled and lurched\nagainst overturned chairs, and tripped over articles dropped in the\nhasty escape of those who had preceded them.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXII\n\n          POVERTY MAKES ONE ACQUAINTED WITH STRANGE BEDFELLOWS\n\n\nSetting down the basket at the corner of a neighbouring street, the men\nwent back to see what else could be thus rescued. Evarne sat on her box\nand waited. Her umbrella was lost. The rain was still pouring down\nsteadily, persistently; along the gutters the water rushed in torrents,\nthe skies and the earth were alike enveloped in damp obscurity. No\nliving being appeared; indeed, practically the only sign of the\nexistence of mankind was the feeble jet of the street lamp, which\nreflected its gleam in the wet pavement as in a lake.\n\nSo long did the girl wait, that, despite the discomfort of her unique\nsituation, she fell into a sort of vague reverie, and a curious feeling\nof abstraction from her own personality crept over her. Was it really\nshe indeed--Evarne Stornway--who was out here in the middle of the night\nin this drenching rain, seated in solitary misery upon the box\ncontaining all her worldly possessions, at some unknown street corner of\na small town in Scotland? Unreasonably enough, it appealed to her as a\nmost extraordinary thing that _she_ should be the individual chosen out\nof all humanity to be thus strangely circumstanced this night.\n\nShe was aroused by hearing her name shouted in the distance. In response\nto her answering call a couple of figures appeared, and Mont's voice\nsaid--\n\n\"Couldn't find this blessed corner again in the mist. Jess has sent down\na message that she's gone to supper with Joe, and will you come too? You\nhad better. There's always a nice fire there of an evening, and you look\nsoaked through.\"\n\n\"I only look what I am, then. Certainly I'll go, if Jess is there. What\nabout my box?\"\n\n\"Brown and I will carry it round to Mrs. Sargeant's and tell her you'll\nboth be late. Do you know your way to our diggings?\"\n\n\"I don't know where I am now, one bit.\"\n\nMont explained, and Evarne accordingly hurried off through the downpour.\n\nOn reaching her destination she was received with cheers. Most of the\ncompany seemed gathered in Mrs. Shiells's kitchen. The house itself was\nlet out in tenements, and theatrical lodgings were obtainable on\npractically every floor. Thus all the actors were residing in the one\nbuilding, and the kitchen of good-natured Mrs. Shiells was the general\nrendezvous.\n\nIn due course Mont and Brown returned, and with them came news of fresh\ncomplications. Madame Cheape had gone! She had been back to her room,\npacked up all her belongings and taken them with her, leaving behind\nonly the assurance that the other young ladies had the money for her\nrent. Mrs. Sargeant had evidently been drinking again, but not to the\npoint of forgetting the piano. It belonged to her daughter, it seemed;\nit had been lent without its lawful owner's leave, and if it was not in\nits place when that daughter returned at eleven, Mrs. Sargeant\ncontemplated being half-slaughtered by her offspring, whose temper, when\naroused, she described as \"enough to make the 'air stand up on your\n'ead.\"\n\n\"Oh dear! I forgot the piano,\" faltered Jess.\n\n\"I tried to get it out, I swear I did,\" avowed Douglas. \"The owner of\nthe hall made two men sit on it until the door was locked. He's going to\nkeep it in pawn until he gets his nine pounds fourteen.\"\n\n\"And Madame Cheape never gave us any money, did she?\"\n\n\"Not one farthing.\"\n\nA grim silence prevailed. How were they to face this terrible Miss\nSargeant? One of the lodgers and the piano, both departed--flitted away!\n\n\"I advise this,\" said Archie ultimately. \"Let Miss Stornway's basket be\nbrought round here, and you girls go and pack up all your other\nbelongings and bring them along too. Then each pay Mrs. Sargeant your\nrespective shares of the rent you had all agreed upon--twelve-and-six,\nwasn't it? That's four and twopence each. Tell her old Cheape has\nsloped, but that the piano is all right, and will come home sooner or\nlater. Then if she still chooses to kick up a row, she can't stick to\nany of your props, that's one thing.\"\n\n\"We really oughtn't to be expected to suffer for either the Cheape's or\nthe Punter's tricks, ought we?\" demanded Jess, and so Archie's plan of\ncampaign was adopted.\n\nThe interview passed off quite easily. The terrible Miss Sargeant had\nnot yet returned; the old woman accepted their eight-and-fourpence\nwithout demur, and a blouse that Madame Cheape had overlooked as a\nsubstitute for the remaining four-and-twopence. Both girls united in\nassuring her that the precious piano was in safe keeping, and that she\nwas to impress this fact upon her daughter.\n\nThey then hastened back to Mrs. Shiells's warm, cosy kitchen, feasted on\nhot broth and discussed the desperate state of affairs. At last it\nbecame needful to return to their own cheerless rooms to sleep. The men\nin a group escorted them through the dark, deserted roads. But Archie\nwas in a thoroughly furious temper, and Douglas was never a sucking\ndove. As the group stood for a final chat in the street outside Mrs.\nSargeant's house, these two, from angry disputing, set to work to settle\ntheir differences of opinion by seeing who could hit hardest.\n\nA general uproar resulted, starting peaceful Ayr from its first\nslumbers. All along the street, upper windows were flung open, and heads\nappeared, startled or curious. Suddenly yet another sound was clearly\nheard above all the confusion--the angry bang of a door, the sharp\nturning of a key, and the drawing of bolts. The girls were locked out!\n\nA sudden hush descended, and for a moment everyone stood spellbound.\nThen Evarne quickly sped across the street, and banged with the knocker\nagain and again. The only response took the form of a young woman\nappearing at an upper window.\n\n\"You folk don't seem to know that we keep a respectable house,\" she\ncried. \"We are not going to have females here who don't know how to\nbehave themselves, and who are thieves into the bargain. If you get over\nma, who's a fool, and come stealing my piano--my piano, what I paid for\nmyself--well, if ma lets herself be sucked in by a lot of sneaking\nscoundrels like you are, all of you, I tell you straight out we're not\ngoing to have women here who brawl in the streets in the middle of the\nnight, as well as steal pianos; so you can take yourselves off, and if\neither of you two, who call yourselves ladies I dare say, show your\nnoses here again, I'll have you clapped into prison for stealing a\nrespectable woman's piano. You needn't think you're going to sleep\nbeneath this roof to-night, so be off with you, piano thieves.\"\n\nHere she banged down the window with such violence that the glass\nrattled in the casement. Dead silence prevailed in the street.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" faltered Douglas, quite subdued. \"It's all my fault from\nbeginning to end.\"\n\n\"Well, it's no use standing here, I suppose,\" declared Evarne in rather\na shaking voice. \"Come along, Jess; we'll go back to Mrs. Shiells and\nsee what she can do for us. I'm sure she will let us sit in her kitchen\ntill morning, anyway.\"\n\n\"Archie and I will give up our bed,\" cried remorseful Douglas, as the\nglum little procession, under the gauntlet of many eyes, turned to\nretrace its steps.\n\n\"What a bad, wicked creature to shut us out in the streets at this time\nof night,\" declared Jess with emphasis, then sniffed, suspiciously close\nto tears.\n\n\"Don't cry till you see the end of it,\" advised Evarne, stoical from\nvery misery. \"How can we know whether it be good or bad angels that have\nplanned all these unforeseen events? Anything that appears to be\nentirely hateful--like this whole evening has been--may be but a\npreliminary to happiness!\" But her heart was as heavy as lead as she\nspoke.\n\n\"Goodness gracious me! What a queer girl you are to talk like a minister\nin his pulpit while we are sloshing through the mud and the rain with\nnowhere to sleep!\" laughed Jess, highly amused; whereupon Evarne\nsmilingly inquired what more appropriate moment could be chosen.\n\nMrs. Shiells was kindness itself. Surely, she would find a haven for the\npuir lassies, she declared. Let them wait a moment.\n\nAfter a brief absence she returned, accompanied by another brawny Scotch\ndame. She had believed Miss Brodie here had a vacant room, she said, but\nshe was mistaken. However, it was nigh two o'clock. There wasn't much\nmore of the night before them. She'd be pleased if one of the lassies\nwould share her bed, and would the other sleep with Miss Brodie?\n\nGratefully the girls accepted this offer. It was arranged that Jess\nshould stay with Mrs. Shiells, and in less than a quarter of an hour\nEvarne found herself lying in the darkness by the side of this new good\nSamaritan who had so recently appeared upon the scene.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\n\n                            A FRESH TURNING\n\n\nMiss Brodie had apologised for not having a spare bed.\n\n\"If it had been the morn's nicht, noo,\" she explained. \"I've got ma\nsister frae Lunnon stoppin' wi' me, she's in the only vacant room, but\nshe'll be awa' again the morn.\"\n\nOf course, Evarne emphatically declared that she did not envy the sister\nthe spare room one jot, and soon after this they composed themselves to\nrest.\n\nBut Evarne wooed sleep in vain. In silence and darkness and strangeness;\nthe excitement of the evening, with its sustaining power all past; the\ncompany finally disbanded and deserted; everything chaos for the\npresent--and for the morrow----? She had now a shilling and a halfpenny\nleft in the world. Supposing she pawned some of her garments, and thus\ngot back to Glasgow, wherein had she at all bettered her position? What\ncould she do for the next night, let alone the nights to come? How long\nwould it be now before she was both hungry and penniless? Would she then\nhave to go into the workhouse--or what?\n\nShe shuddered in bed, and writhed her fingers as if suffering physical\nagony. The cruel horror of the immediate future seemed to crush her as\nshe lay. For the sake of her bedfellow she forced herself to remain\nsilent and motionless for what seemed an interminable period. But giving\nway to a sudden invincible panic induced by accumulated reflections on\nmany possibilities, she started up violently, and cried in a voice that\nscarcely sounded her own--\n\n\"Oh Heaven! What am I to do?\" Then, burying her face in her hands, she\nwept unrestrainedly.\n\nAn arm crept round her waist, and she was gently drawn to the side of\nher companion.\n\n\"Puir lassie,\" said the kindly voice. \"You're o'er-rocht. Dinna greet,\nbut lie quiet and see what daylight brings. You've a' had a verra tryin'\ntime here, but you'll sune be hame aince mair wi' your frien's, and\nmayhap a kind fayther or mither to welcome ye.\"\n\n\"Oh no, no!\" sobbed the girl, \"I've got no one--nothing--no parents, no\nhome or friends or anything! Oh, what shall I do? what will become of\nme?\"\n\nMiss Brodie leaned out of bed and lit a candle.\n\n\"The dark is na cheerie,\" she declared.\n\nEvarne managed to choke down her grief, and lay back upon the pillow\nonce more.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to have awakened you. Please go to sleep again. I'm going\nto be quite still and quiet now.\"\n\n\"Dinna think o' me,\" said the kind-hearted Scots-woman. \"What o'\nyoursel', puir bairn? It's a terrible thing for a lassie to be a' her\nlain i' the world.\"\n\nGradually Evarne was prevailed upon to confide the seriousness of her\nplight. Miss Brodie grew more and more pitying and sympathetic.\n\n\"I'll consult wi' ma sister,\" she said, at length. \"Jean has got verra\nsharp wits frae being in Lunnon. She will advise ye. Anyway, ma lamb,\ndinna think that I'll turn ye oot a' at aince, though ye had naething in\nthe whole world but a tongue to say 'thank ye' wi'.\"\n\nEvarne kissed her again and again.\n\n\"I do meet kind friends, anyway,\" she whispered, and encircled by Miss\nBrodie's motherly arms, she at length fell asleep.\n\nNotwithstanding the disturbances of the night, the thrifty Scotswoman\nrose as usual shortly after daybreak, and by the time Evarne had awoke,\ndressed and wandered out into the kitchen, she found that her\ndifficulties and distresses had already been the subject of careful\ndebate between Martha and Jean Brodie.\n\nThe latter, a tall, angular young woman, with a somewhat careworn\nexpression, had justified her sister's confidence by almost instantly\nproducing a suggestion anent the vexed question of earning a livelihood\nwithout a week's delay. Waiting only until Martha had ladled out a\nplateful of porridge and set it before Evarne, she opened the subject\nwithout any preliminary remarks.\n\n\"Are you at all a good needlewoman, Miss Stornway?\"\n\n\"Only pretty fair,\" was the truthful response. \"I've done a lot of\nembroidery, but scarcely any plain sewing. I made this blouse I've got\non, though; but not without help.\"\n\n\"That will do. Now, if my sister didn't exaggerate, if you're really\npenniless and don't know which way to turn----\"\n\nEvarne cast down her eyes.\n\n\"That's right enough,\" she said; \"go on.\"\n\n\"In that case I can give you a job myself--that is, if you're not too\nproud to work hard and live humbly.\"\n\nHere was indeed a surprise.\n\n\"Only try me,\" declared the girl eagerly. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps Martha told you I was a blousemaker by trade. I work for a\nwholesale house in the City. I haven't got a big business, but I live by\nit, and I always have a young girl under me as an apprentice to do\ncertain parts of the word. Generally, my assistant lives and boards with\nme, I pay her half a crown a week and teach her the business. As soon as\nthe girl is past the apprentice stage she leaves me and I get another\nbeginner. My last one left me just before I came away for my holiday. My\ngirls are generally only about fourteen or fifteen; but if you care to\ntake the job for a time, it's open to you at once, and you'll get a\nbetter berth presently like the others, if you choose to continue in the\nneedlework line. There's my offer.\"\n\n\"I daursay it seems a bit o' a come-doon i' the world to you,\"\ninterposed Martha, \"but when all's said and done it's a respectable,\nGod-fearin' business that no woman need be ashamed o'.\"\n\n\"Think it over while you eat your breakfast,\" advised Jean.\n\nEvarne was distinctly startled at an entirely fresh career being thus\nsuddenly dangled before her gaze for inspection. The remuneration\noffered, two-and-six weekly, likewise proved amazing. Still, board and\nlodging were included in the bond, and, after the terrible pictures her\nimagination had painted in the blackness of the past night, the certain\nassurance of a sheltering roof, and of bread to ward off the pangs of\nhunger, was alone sufficient to form a bright constellation of stars in\nher dark sky. Not long did she stop to consider whether these\nnewly-risen orbs were of a colour and design pleasing to her fancy.\nBetween the fifth and sixth spoonfuls of porridge she had signified her\nwillingness to become a blouse apprentice.\n\n\"Then pack up your things as soon as you've done eating. We must catch\nthe half-past eleven train, because of my excursion ticket.\"\n\n\"How--I hadn't thought of that--how am I to get my fare?\" faltered\nEvarne painfully.\n\n\"I'm going to lend it to ye, lassie, and sure, you can pay me back week\nby week,\" declared Martha.\n\nEvarne endeavoured to express her gratitude, but the only answer she got\nwas--\n\n\"It's naething at a'. Jist keep your breath to cool your porridge, and\nmake haste too.\"\n\nSpeedily finishing her meal, the girl went upstairs to Mrs. Shiells's.\nThere, in the kitchen, she found a heated quarrel in progress. The\n\"loot\" of the disbanded \"Caledonia's Bard\" was the bone of contention.\nArchie had carefully packed the limes-box round with stage garments,\nenclosed the whole in a drop-scene, tied it all up with gas-tubing, and\nthen calmly announced that this was his \"little share.\" Since there was\nnot much left of any description, all the other members of the late\ncompany, headed by Douglas, were vigorously protesting.\n\nAlready Archie had been discovered trying to palm off upon his landlady,\nin lieu of money, a couple of long cylinders containing gas--dangerous,\nexplosive, useless objects to which no one would willingly even give\nhouse-room. General indignation had been provoked by this attempt at\nreturning evil for good, and amid the general uproar it was some time\nbefore Evarne could persuade the excited party to turn their attention\nto her, and realise that she had come to bid them farewell.\n\nThe regrets expressed at this parting were perfectly sincere on both\nsides. Evarne was being swooped off, leaving many mysteries unsolved.\nWhere was Madame Cheape? What would befall the piano that day? Would Mr.\nPunter try to reclaim any of his stage belongings? Moreover, it appeared\nthat that gentleman's whereabouts were being eagerly inquired after by a\nnumber of the leading tradesmen of the district, who had been persuaded\nto pay cash down for advertisement spaces on the back of the company's\nprogrammes, misled by the assurance of a prolonged local tour for\n\"Caledonia's Bard\"--a fact that went a long way toward explaining the\nwhole strange business. Jess and Mont both undertook to write and tell\nEvarne all the news, but ere she well knew how it had come to pass, she\nfound herself in the train being whirled back to London.\n\nAnother act in the \"Drama of Reality\" had commenced.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\n\n                       \"STITCH, STITCH, STITCH!\"\n\n\nThe house in which Miss Jean Brodie rented a single room stood in a\nby-street in the heart of Camberwell. Despite the knowledge that any\nfeelings of fastidiousness were now entirely unseemly and out of place,\nEvarne could not avoid a certain dismay at the prospect of actually\nresiding amid such abject poverty, disorder and squalor. Threading their\nway between the swarming dirty children, who shouted and played and\ndisputed on every side, numerous as rabbits in a warren, they entered a\ndark, narrow passage and proceeded to mount the uncarpeted stairs.\n\n\"My room is on the top floor,\" explained Miss Brodie, as the first\nlanding was gained. \"Rents are very high in London. There are seven\nseparate lots of people living in this house.\"\n\nAt this juncture a voice came from one of the half-open doors they were\npassing--\n\n\"What did I do? Why, I says quite perlite-like, ''Ave a drop o' gin, ol'\ndear,' but she ups and says to me, she says----\"\n\nBut what \"she\" had responded to this invitation was lost in a peal of\nlaughter from several throats. Miss Brodie looked supercilious.\n\n\"That's Mrs. Harbert. You won't need to talk to her at all. She's not a\nvery respectable old woman. I'm sure I wonder the landlord has her in\nthe house; but there, he doesn't heed anything so long as he gets his\nrent punctually.\"\n\nEvarne glanced back over her shoulder, and surveyed this wicked\npersonage! She saw a cleanly, neatly-clad, comfortable-looking old dame\nof about sixty, who still retained traces of unusual good looks. She\nseemed so good-natured and happy that Evarne inquired with some interest\ninto the character of her misdemeanours. She was more entertained than\nappalled by the information. The culprit had been an artist's model, and\nthe walls of her room were now absolutely covered with innumerable\npaintings and drawings depicting herself in the days of her youth, \"but\nwith not a decent stitch of clothing among the whole lot, my dear.\"\n\nMiss Brodie's own apartment, though poor in the extreme, was certainly\nrespectability itself. As was most suitable in a room principally\ndesigned for needlework, the floor was uncarpeted, while the bed, with\nthe narrow rug by its side, the washing-stand and the few clothes-pegs,\nwere all huddled as much out of the way as possible. The place of honour\nin the centre of the room was given to the substantial table necessary\nfor cutting out, while by the light of the window stood the\nsewing-machine. On the mantelpiece were china ornaments in couples, a\npair of pink vases, and some cheap frames holding family photographs. On\nthe walls were  texts and several gloomy memorial cards.\n\nAnd within these precincts Evarne started upon a life the conditions of\nwhich she had hitherto never dreamed of, far less realised. Work\ncommencing at eight in the morning, the stretch of hours until eight at\nnight was unbroken save by a brief time for meals. Day in and day\nout--except for the blessed Sabbath--week following week in slow\nprocession, still found her bent over her needle, stitch, stitch,\nstitching as fast as her skill allowed.\n\nAt first, while yet unbroken to the yoke, she many a time seriously\nfeared that the day then passing would be the very last of its kind that\nshe could possibly manage to endure. The nerve-pangs of irritability and\nimpatience, of well-nigh uncontrollable rebellion and revolt--all\nconcealed with difficulty, but not thereby conquered--seared her spirit\nfar more deeply than her left forefinger was pricked and torn by the\nneedle driven at unaccustomed speed. Sometimes she would stop working\nfor a minute, straighten her back, let her hands, together with the\nmaterial, drop loosely upon her lap, while she would glance over at Jean\nwith an expression that said plainly, \"Is it _really_ possible to endure\nthis?\"\n\nBut Miss Brodie during work-hours was as a part of her machine--she\nnever ceased, never looked either to the right or to the left--so that\nafter a minute or two nothing remained for the as yet unresigned\napprentice but to stifle a sigh--or maybe even a groan--and again take\nup the labour at which her whole nature was vigorously protesting.\n\nShe wondered if she was naturally idle, or if all other needlewomen had\nhad to get the mastery over similar feelings to those that ramped in her\nbreast, when the monotonous occupation had to be continued for long\nweary hours after it had become thoroughly uncongenial? Did Miss Brodie,\nfor instance, not know what it was to feel every pulse of her body\naching and crying for movement--change--liberty? Was she never conscious\nthat her brain was frantically protesting against the maddening\nmonotony--the unvarying sameness--the crushing tedium of pushing that\nneedle in, then pulling that needle out, again and again and again, as\nsteadily as her pulses beat or her heart throbbed? Did Jean never have\nto fight against an almost uncontrollable impulse to scream, shout, wave\nher arms, stamp, swear, play ball with her work, tear down \"God Bless\nour Home,\" and throw it out of the window; do something--anything--wild,\nmad and unseemly, to relieve the tedium and assuage the awful tumult of\noverwrought nerves?\n\nBut whatever storms might rage within the recesses of her own mind, Miss\nBrodie was ever outwardly calm--but then Evarne was to all appearances\nequally passive, equally resigned. She never once complained. While\npitying herself as frankly as she sorrowed over a squirrel upon the\nwheel; a wood-bird shut in a tiny cage; a young dog fastened to its\nkennel in a walled-in yard, strangling itself frantically against its\ncollar; she suffered all in total silence.\n\nHowever, Jean had an outside interest--a hope that beyond a doubt served\nto lighten and brighten the tedium of these days of toil. She was\nengaged to be married to a dashing red-coated soldier, and many of the\nends of her evenings were spent in his inspiriting society.\n\nEvarne's spare hours were passed in absolute loneliness and solitude.\nAfter supper she would wander out, generally along the Embankment, but\nif she had sufficient energy she would persevere as far as Hyde Park. At\nall events she would walk about somewhere until she was wearied, not\nreturning home until it was time to go to bed. It was a grey,\nsoul-crushing existence, and she grew depressed and spiritless beneath\nits burden.\n\nShe made no effort to change it for anything better. Miss Brodie was\nsatisfied with her, and was always kind. One thing was as good as\nanother, and incompetence was a drug in the labour market. Everyone,\ntoo, by whom she was now surrounded laboured more or less incessantly;\nwork made up their lives. She was no miserable exception, no victim, no\nmartyr. Her fate seemed but the common fate of all.\n\n\"It's a real pity you can't get a young man, Miss Stornway,\" said Miss\nBrodie, worried by her apprentice's unconcealable pallor and\nlistlessness. \"It certainly does seem to make everything so much\neasier.\"\n\nThe girl smiled and shook her head. Indeed, Camberwell was as likely to\nproduce a \"young man\" for Evarne as was a desert island. Not that she\nwas overlooked by the male sex; on the contrary, in common with every\ngirl who is at once poor and beautiful, practically every man who had\nany sort of opportunity commenced, sooner or later, to make love to her.\nQuite often strange men turned and walked by her side in the parks,\nseeking to engage her in conversation. But not for one instant was the\nproud purity of the beautiful face disturbed. Evarne had loved Morris\nKenyon as truly and purely as ever any young girl loved. By the shameful\narts of the street _rou\u00e9_ she was profoundly repelled. So as far as\nmasculine society went, she lived the life of a young nun.\n\nShe seemed to have nothing left save memories, and these were all\ntainted with cruel bitterness. As the weary weeks lengthened into months\nthe acuteness of all past emotions--joys and anguish alike--became\ndimmed, and then faded away. What had been once her life seemed now only\na story she had read long ago. That brilliant room at \"Mon Bijou\"; the\nlovely garden with its winding mosaic walks; the blueness of the Naples\nBay; the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland; her dainty flat and her\ncarriage here in London; the vivid sun of Egypt--none of this was real,\nsurely? Reality was scanty fare in a top garret--incessant\nstitching--loneliness--and nothing else!\n\nAnd her love for Morris that she would once have sworn could have\nsurvived all blows, all passing of time, was as much a thing of the past\nas were all these other memories. Morris had slain it himself once and\nfor ever. For some time she had cherished the corpse, not knowing it to\nbe lifeless; but gradually the deceptive outward tokens of vitality\nfaded away. A little longer and the dead thing fell to dust and was no\nmore. The glamour of Morris's presence removed enabled her to see more\nclearly, not only the unforgivable nature of the insults with which he\nhad cast her off, but the great wrong he had done her in the first\nplace, and which had directly led down to these dregs wherein she was\nnow drowning.\n\nIf she had any feeling for him other than indifference, it was hatred.\nShe felt no gratitude--not one jot--for the money or the care and\nattention he had once lavished upon her. It had been nothing to him. And\nsince she was merely one of many women who in turn occupied those rooms\nat \"Mon Bijou,\" she had no more call to be grateful for any of the\naccompanying accessories of the position than had the horses that passed\nthrough his stables.\n\nShe was utterly discontented and unhappy in her present existence. True,\nshe had safe shelter, sufficient to wear, and enough to eat to keep life\nwithin her--but, merciful Heaven, what a price she paid for that\ndoubtful boon! Morning after morning she regained consciousness with\nreluctance, shrinking from the joyless, unbroken monotony of the day\nthat stretched its weary length before her--anxious only to get it done\nand added to those that were already lived through. She never read now,\nfor her eyes ached painfully long ere work was ended.\n\nTortured at first by her unemployed powers of heart and brain and soul\nfighting for expression, all too soon she became bitterly conscious that\nthey were yielding to disuse--becoming crushed and deadened. It did seem\nhard to have to put all her strength, all her active energies of mind\nand body--all herself--into the making of cheap blouses. She felt she\nwas being wasted, but that it was inevitable. What was being killed in\nher would not make money.\n\nIt was some time before she could realise that she had found her true\nlevel in life's struggle, and that needlework was her doom. At first she\nwas always waiting for something to \"turn up,\" for the unexpected to\nhappen.\n\n    \"'And is this all of life?' she said;\n    'This daily toil for daily bread?'\"\n\nAnd as the conviction grew that this cruel question must be answered in\nthe affirmative--that all heretofore had been but prelude, unstable and\nfleeting, that this was life now upon her in grim serious earnest--her\nheart grew bitter, and her once sweet, bright expression gave way to a\nsettled look of sad discontent.\n\nBut through all this her resolution to lead evermore a \"good\" life never\nfaltered. She would not even contemplate endeavouring to bring sparks of\nbrightness into her cheerless existence by setting aflame any man's\naffection, legally or otherwise. Come what might, she had done with that\nsort of thing once and for all.\n\nMrs. Burling she visited once or twice, but her correspondence with both\nMargaret and Jess slackened and ceased. Separated and so unhappy, she\nfound it difficult to know what to say to them, while they both could\nproduce but heavy and laboured epistles. She liked Jean Brodie fairly\nwell, but they were very opposed in character, and for the greater\nportion of each day the silence of the workroom was unbroken save for\nthe clipping of the scissors or the whirring of the machine.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXV\n\n                               HARD LUCK\n\n\nBut although Evarne would not have deemed it possible, worse still\nremained for her upon the knees of the gods.\n\nJean Brodie returned home one Sunday in a state of unconcealed\nexcitement.\n\n\"Miss Stornway, I'm going to be married. The banns are to be called for\nthe first time next Sabbath. My young man's regiment is going out to\nIndia in six weeks, and he's just got leave to marry 'on the strength,'\nso he can take me with him.\"\n\nAfter suitable congratulations, and so on, the conversation veered round\nto Evarne.\n\n\"If you follow my advice, Miss Stornway, you'll carry on my business.\nYou've done a lot of good work for me, my dear, so in memory of that\nI'll give you all--well, nearly all--the furniture of the room. I must\ntake a few things with me, and I can't let you have my sewing-machine,\nbut you can procure a nice one on the hire system. Then get a young girl\nas an apprentice. I'll introduce you to the City firm I work for, and\nyou'll be comfortably settled. What do you say?\"\n\nEvarne naturally thanked her, whereupon Miss Brodie set forth the\nexpenditure of the establishment.\n\n\"The work brings in above seventeen shillings weekly. Two shillings is\nenough to pay the apprentice, a young girl, you know. There's\nthree-and-six for rent, add to which you must allow three-and-six for\nyour machine, that's nine shillings. That leaves you with eight\nshillings for food for the two of you, candles, a bit of firing, the\ngoose club, the church collection, twopence for a hot bath--everything\nelse, in fact. It seems very little somehow! I know, it's the hiring of\nthe machine takes your money. I've managed to save some every week, and\nso will you in time.\"\n\nThus the matter was settled. Evarne was present at Jean's marriage, and\na few days later waved her farewell from the station as the good\nScotswoman departed with the other soldiers' wives. Then the girl walked\nback to her now empty room with a fresh sense of depression. After all,\nJean had been a friend in need, and had remained her only intimate\nacquaintance in London.\n\nAs she wended her way upstairs a sudden stumble was heard on the upper\nflight, and immediately after half a dozen rosy apples came bounding\ndown. At the same time the disreputable Mrs. Harbert's voice was heard\ncalling shrilly--\n\n\"'Ere, Smithkins! Come to the rescue! Buck up! Everything's a-goin'.\"\n\nThus abjured, Mrs. Smithkins hurried out from her room and lent her aid.\nEvarne, having gathered up the apples, joining the group.\n\n\"Here's something of yours,\" she said.\n\n\"Good retriever! 'Ave one,\" was the response.\n\nSomewhat objecting to be thus described, the girl declined the gift, and\nwas continuing her way upstairs.\n\n\"Wait a bit. I must give yer somethin' for yer trouble, me dear. I'll\nlearn yer some cookin'. Best and quickest way to make a sausage roll.\nD'you know it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Take a sausage to the top of the stairs and chuck it down--like them\napples rolled. See? Ha, ha! Shakespeare! No, not 'im this time. That was\nthe clown at the pantomime last year.\"\n\nEvarne certainly thought the old dame was slightly incoherent, and\nsmiling indulgently took another step upstairs.\n\n\"Done it!\" declared Mrs. Harbert triumphantly.\n\n\"What 'ave yer done now?\" inquired Mrs. Smithkins.\n\n\"Made 'er laugh! Said I would. I fair 'ate to see a glum look on a\npretty face. You've lost yer friend, Miss Stornway. Now, won't yer come\nin an' 'ave a cosy cup o' tea along o' me?\"\n\n\"An' see 'er wunnerful pictures,\" sniggered Mrs. Smithkins.\n\n\"Jist be off with yer. To the pure all things is white as wool.\nShakespeare! Miss Stornway's a real laidy. She knows Shakespeare, I bet.\nYou ask 'er.\"\n\nAll this certainly succeeded in distracting Evarne's mind.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"I shall very much like to come.\"\n\nThe visit turned out very successful, though it was perforce but brief,\nas the girl had to be back at her labours again. Only by uninterrupted\nindustry could the requisite number of blouses be finished, and Evarne,\nwith only a few weeks' practice at machining, was far less rapid than\nhad been Miss Brodie with her ten years' experience. Milly, the new\nfourteen-year-old apprentice, was clumsy and somewhat idle, so that\nthere was now less time than ever in Evarne's life for protracted\nafternoon calls.\n\nDay after day she worked with a will, and though at first her uttermost\nendeavours only brought in about fourteen-and-sixpence each week, she\nrapidly grew more skilful. Milly, too, became quicker and more useful,\nand things were thus promising to become decidedly easier when an\nunforeseen accident occurred. It was just one of those foolish little\nmishaps that nobody can always succeed in guarding against. This one was\nvery unromantic in its origin. Evarne was seated on the side of one of\nthe public baths, polishing and paring and generally attending to her\npretty pink feet and nails, when somehow she lost her balance and fell.\nIn saving herself from splashing half-dressed into the water, she\ncontrived to drive the point of the scissors into her finger, right down\nto the bone.\n\nIt only left a little wound, which Mrs. Harbert tied up with a piece of\nrag, and although it was the right hand, the girl continued her work\nnext day as if nothing had happened. But in the night the pain grew so\nbad that it awoke her and prevented her sleeping again, while the\ndaylight showed the wounded finger to be ominously blue and swollen.\nThis spread with terrible rapidity and ere long her hand was totally\nuseless. Full of alarm she hurried off to the hospital, and had her\nsuspicions of blood-poisoning confirmed. The poor hand was carefully\nbandaged up and put into a sling, and, almost overwhelmed by this new\nanxiety, the girl returned home to see what could be done about her\nwork.\n\nEverything now devolved upon Milly. Evarne contrived to cut out the\nblouses with her left hand, and to do a little tacking, but all else had\nto be left to the apprentice. Evarne could but encourage and supervise,\nand wearying work that proved. Even in these new circumstances Milly was\nstill slow and idle, and if she was pressed to work faster, she ceased\nsewing altogether and whimpered.\n\nThus a miserable three shillings was all that could be earned in the\nfirst week, and the next six days showed an increase of but ninepence.\nEvarne had about half a sovereign laid by, and out of this she paid\nMilly's wages and the hire of the all-precious machine. But in the\nsecond week, when the landlord made his usual Monday rent-collecting\nvisit, she was forced to beg his indulgence, showing her blue and\nbandaged hand as an excuse and explanation. At first he told her roughly\nenough that he did not run his houses as a philanthropic undertaking,\nand that if his tenants could not pay they just had to go. But finally\nhe grew more sympathetic, and at last quite kind. He actually promised\nto take no steps whatsoever for a month, and if she stayed on after that\nshe could make it up at the rate of a shilling a week.\n\nShe recovered the partial use of her hand in less than the stipulated\ntime, and resumed her place at the machine. But she had now got\nthoroughly backward with money matters. Only by pawning everything in\nthe room that was not absolutely essential could she pay both rent and\nmachine hire, and the eight to ten shillings that was all her still\ncrippled hand was able to earn seemed to be swallowed up immediately she\nreceived it. Only about eighteen-pence at the outside could she manage\nto retain to buy food for herself and her apprentice.\n\nNow, Miss Milly was not particular, and had made few complaints at being\nreduced to a diet of potatoes and bread and scrape; tea made of leaves\nused a second time; rice boiled in water and sweetened by a little\ncondensed milk, and so on. When, however, the quantity came to be also\nunpleasantly restricted her hearty appetite, unappeased, rendered her\ndecidedly fractious.\n\nHer honorarium had been reduced by Miss Stornway to a shilling weekly,\non the promise that it should be more than made up later, but now she\nwas apparently expected to spend even this miserable half-pay on\nsustaining life. True, Miss Stornway always took far the smaller portion\nof every meagre meal, but unfortunately even that fact did not fill the\ncavity in Milly's stomach. So the day came when that damsel, being\nentrusted with a penny and sent out to purchase an ounce of tea,\nreturned no more. In the evening came a note:\n\n    \"DERE MISS,\n\n    \"i've gorn ome to my mother Because i wants more to eat. it aint\n    your forlt miss nor it aint mine and mother Says its rite if you\n    works ard you ort to ave Enuf to eat two shillings you Ows me\n    dont trubble about miss Eat it.\n\n                           \"Yours respeckful,\n                                                            \"MILLY.\"\n\nWhether a sting or a kindness lay in the closing sentence, Evarne knew\nnot, but all the statements in the letter were as clearly undeniable as\nwas the fact that Milly had deserted her. She felt both ashamed and\nstrangely forsaken, and crushing the scrap of paper in her hand, rested\nher pale cheek on the bare boards of the table, while tears of\nfeebleness and helplessness rolled from her weary eyes and slowly soaked\ntheir way into the wood.\n\nHampered as she was by her still awkwardly swollen and painful hand,\nwith those terrible debts clinging like leeches, and with the imperative\nneed there had been for every penny that she and her assistant had\nearned by their united efforts, she could not conceive how she was\npossibly to manage without any help whatsoever. Milly might have stood\nby her a little longer, she thought sadly.\n\nThere was no chance of economising on anything save food, and to such\nlengths was she now forced to carry this disastrous self-denial, that\nthe uninitiated might have supposed she was trying to solve the problem\nof how to live without eating. Naturally dainty, she had, in Jean's day,\noften left untouched much of the indifferent food provided. Now she\nconsumed far rougher and more unpalatable meals to the last crumb with\navidity, and once or twice even ignobly consumed what should have been\nher supper at the same time as her dinner.\n\nShe bravely persevered with her work, cutting-out and machining and\nstitching from early morning until darkness descended. Even then she\ncontinued her weary labours with the work held close up to the light of\na guttering candle, until practical inability to see longer forced her\nto cease, to throw herself upon her bed and sleep.\n\nBut the night time brought very imperfect rest. Constantly she was\nawakened by the vividness of dreams of banquets; well-stored provision\nshops; food lying in the very gutter while people held her back from\nreaching it; boards lavishly spread, whence every dish faded immediately\nshe thrust forth her hand to grasp its contents.\n\nScarcely ever did she leave the four bare walls of her room, save for\nnecessary business. Not only had she neither time nor strength, but now\nthe soles of her shoes were worn into great holes and her stockings were\nno longer mendable, so that her bare feet trod the pavement, and became\nbruised and blistered.\n\nAnd every effort, additional to the day's routine, was to be avoided.\nScarcely could she drag herself up of a morning, repeatedly would she\nfind that the treadle of the machine was being worked slower and yet\nmore slowly, as a dull stupor and inertness crept like a fog over her\nmind. Once she wasted a whole afternoon by fainting, and came to herself\nto find that nightfall had set in while she was lying unconscious upon\nthe floor.\n\n\"I wonder if I'm going to die? Perhaps I ought to warn somebody or--or\ndo something. I wonder?\" She asked herself this question one late\nafternoon as she finished tying up the parcel of completed blouses, and\nfound that she could not walk across the room with them without\nstaggering and reeling.\n\nShe recalled a ghastly account she had read in the paper, of a man who\nhad died in a locked-up flat, and was never discovered until his corpse\ndecomposed and soaked through the floor to the ceiling below.\n\n\"Mrs. Harbert is just underneath me. I wonder if she would move if that\nhappened?\" Evarne grimly and wretchedly pondered as she commenced to\ndescend the stairs.\n\nEre she was half-way down she suddenly stood still. What was happening?\nWhy was there that vast yawning pit below? It wasn't real--no, she knew\nit--but all the same it made her dizzy. She grew blind, and her brain\nseemed to heave madly. Dropping her parcel, she pressed both hands over\nher eyes. Was she swaying to and fro, or were the stairs rocking beneath\nher feet? She made a wild clutch at the banisters, but her fingers\nclosed only upon the air. She was falling--falling--yet could not save\nherself, and a scream of terror rang through the house ere\nunconsciousness closed in upon her, and she fell with a dull thud down\nto the landing below.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\n\n                           EVARNE'S VOCATION\n\n\nWhen Evarne next opened her eyes she was lying cosily enough in bed.\nWhat a strange troubled sleep she had had, so full of confused dreams!\nInstantly came a fear of oversleeping, and she made an effort to rise.\nBut the attempt was vain; even her half-opened lids were insupportably\nheavy. Languidly she let them droop, and then knew nothing more until a\nspoon was placed to her lips, and she felt some warm liquid meandering\ndown her throat. At this the heavy lids were lifted widely in\nastonishment.\n\n\"Bravo! My pretty dolly is made to open its eyes!\" cried a cheery voice,\nand there by her side was old Mrs. Harbert, gazing at her smilingly.\n\nEvarne looked slowly around. This was not her own room--no--all those\nartist's studies--where was it? Then she remembered. She must surely be\nin Mrs. Harbert's own domain.\n\nHer lips shaped the words, \"What am I doing here?\"\n\n\"Ah, ha! My dolly talks,\" was the only answer she received.\n\nThe girl tried to arouse herself further, but enthralled by a heavy\nlethargy, she abandoned the attempt, and gradually fell asleep once\nmore.\n\nWhen next she awoke the sharp sound of a falling cup had aroused her\nmore thoroughly. She lifted her head slightly from the pillow. There\nstood Mrs. Smithkins, looking at her with much concern.\n\n\"Lor' now, I do 'ope I 'aven't done no 'arm by wakin' yer up!\"\n\n\"Am I ill?\" whispered Evarne.\n\n\"You've bin at death's door,\" impressively replied Mrs. Smithkins, with\nobvious satisfaction.\n\n\"I remember. I was going downstairs. Did I fall? Tell me everything.\"\n\n\"The doctor says yer ain't to speak.\"\n\n\"You talk; I'll listen.\"\n\nNothing loath, Mrs. Smithkins set to and related the story. It appeared\nthat everybody in the house had run from their rooms at the sound of\nEvarne's terrible tumble, and, lifting up her unconscious form, had laid\nher upon Mrs. Harbert's bed--the nearest at hand. Her forehead, which\nwas cut and bleeding, had been promptly tied up. But neither lavish\nsprinkling of water, draughts of undiluted gin, the burning of feathers\nnor the tickling of her palms, had sufficed to bring her to her senses,\nso the parish doctor had been called in. He had said a lot of things\nnone of the hearers had been able to properly understand, but finally\nhad said clearly enough that it would be weeks ere she was well again.\n\nMrs. Harbert had undertaken to nurse her, and, according to Mrs.\nSmithkins, had fulfilled this promise like an angel of light. Sometimes\nshe had been forced to be absent for the best part of the day about her\nwork, but she had always prepared the invalid's diet beforehand, and\nMrs. Smithkins had administered it. The doctor had been ever so many\ntimes! Once he even came twice in one day! As to Evarne's room upstairs,\nit was let to somebody else. A man from the firm had come and taken away\nthe sewing machine, her bed was here--Mrs. Harbert now slept on it--her\nchair and table and other belongings were on the landing upstairs.\n\nLeft alone, Evarne lay awake for hours pondering. She half regretted\nthat she had not died; that would so have simplified matters. Now she\nhad the future to worry about once more; and she felt positively\noverwhelmed by the knowledge of her poor old neighbour's extraordinary\ncharity. When evening fell, and Mrs. Harbert entered very softly on\ntiptoe, Evarne greeted her, feeling quite embarrassed by the extent of\nthis debt of gratitude.\n\n\"Why, my dolly is quite well agin, the Lord be praised,\" declared the\nold woman, beaming all over her face.\n\nPlacing on a chair the packed market-basket she carried, she proceeded\nto lay its contents one by one on the table.\n\n\"I've got something for yer,\" she declared, triumphantly holding up a\ncouple of volumes. \"I bought 'em from an old bookstall. 'Rose Leaves or\nStrawberry Leaves? A Romance of Society.' That sounds real exciting, and\nwill amuse 'er, thinks I, and then 'Gull--Gully somebody's Travels.'\nThat will be instructive, and will educate 'er mind.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Harbert, you are far, far too good to me. I shall never be able to\nthank you properly.\"\n\n\"Yer can't do nothin' properly till yer gits well, and the doctor--nice\nold chap 'e is too--says yer ain't to talk.\"\n\n\"Doctors always say that. Why are you so kind to me?\"\n\n\"'Cause I likes it. My gosh, 'ere am I, a lonely old woman, and when\n'Eaven drops a nice-spoken pretty gal, bang splosh at my very front\ndoor, d'you think I was goin' to just git out my broom and sweep 'er\naway? That ain't Philadelphia 'Arbert.\"\n\n\"I'll get well quickly now, not to cause you any more trouble.\"\n\n\"''E goes quickest who takes time by the nose,' as Shakespeare says.\"\n\nEvarne smiled.\n\n\"How did you come to study Shakespeare?\"\n\n\"It was this way. Yer know, my dear, I'm a hartist's model. All these\npictures on the wall are me. I showed 'em to yer once before, didn't I?\nMy gosh, when I was a gal--a young woman--I was real lovely. But yer can\nsee that for yourself, though these 'ere pictures is only students'\nwork, and don't do me real credit. Still, jist notice my shapely legs in\nthis one. Nice bust too, eh! See my back 'ere--there's a fine straight\nback for yer. Every great hartist painted me in them days. I was a\nregular queen among 'em--'eaps more work offered me than I could manage.\nThere was one gentleman--oh, a real nice gentleman 'e was too, pore\ndear, 'e's dead now--and 'e used to 'ave Shakespeare read out to 'im all\nthe time 'e worked. I often posed for 'im, and as I've got a good memory\nI picked it up, and bits of it is always comin' into my mind. My gosh,\nMiss Stornway, I tell yer it do make the other old gals in this 'ouse\nthat jealous! I'm always sittin' on 'em with my quotes, and they can't\ndo nothin' but keep their hignorant old tongues still and look silly.\"\n\nThus she rattled on, meantime proceeding to prepare the evening meal for\nherself and her charge.\n\nDays passed, and having once started upon her convalescence, Evarne\ngained strength rapidly. At the end of a week she was able to leave her\nbed. The colour and contour gradually returned to her pale, thin cheeks,\nthe brightness to her eye, all her marvellous beauty blossomed forth\nafresh. At the end of a fortnight she was strong enough to take her\nfirst outing in the form of a short ride on the top of a 'bus.\n\nOn returning from this expedition she lay down while Mrs. Harbert made\ntea, and over the genial beverage the old woman for the first time\nconsented to discuss future plans. Evarne had two or three various\nsuggestions to bring forward, but Mrs. Harbert would not even listen.\n\n\"There's only one sensible thing for yer to do, Evarne, my gal, and\nthat's to follow in my footsteps. Needlework and sich-like may be all\nright for some, but for you--why, it's jist a wicked waste of Gawd's\ngifts. Now, I'll tell yer, when yer was ill and me and Smithkins was\ngivin' my dolly a bath, I says to 'er, I says, 'My gosh, what a lovely\ngal!' and Smithkins she says----Now, whatever are yer blushin' for, my\ndear? You are a real lovely gal, and I speaks as one who knows what's\nwhat. I never seemed to notice it when yer was bundled up in clothes;\nthat's the way with the best of us, we never appears to advantage in\ntogs. It's the skinny women with waists the size of their ankles, what\nno hartist would so much as look at; or them females as is bundles of\nfat what wouldn't look human if they wasn't packed up tidy into\ncorsets--they're the sort what looks best in their clothes. Beautiful\nwomen like you and me looks better and better as we undresses more and\nmore. You'll make a fortune as a model, and you'll be a bigger fool than\nI take yer for if yer chucks away that fortune.\"\n\nEvarne remained silent, pondering over this suggestion. Instant\nobjections sprang to her mind, but at the same time came the conviction\nthat here indeed was a means of earning a livelihood for which she was\nundeniably well qualified. Her own experience as an artist had taught\nher both the value and the rarity of a figure, beautiful from an\nartistic point of view. At the same time....\n\nMrs. Harbert broke in upon her reflections.\n\n\"Perhaps yer was thinkin' it ain't proper.\"\n\nBut the girl shook her head immediately.\n\n\"No,\" she declared. \"I studied Art myself, and painted from the nude,\nwhen I was better off, so I should have got rid of any ideas of that\nsort, even if I had ever had them; but I never had. I was just thinking\nthat it really was a brilliant notion of yours, but that I didn't quite\nlike it somehow. Still, I believe that if you hadn't spoken just then, I\nshould have gone on to reflect that beggars can't be choosers.\"\n\n\"Ah, Shakespeare! But why don't yer like it, if yer ain't shocked? It's\nthe nicest profession in the world. Takes yer among sich 'igh-class\npeople--real ladies and gentlemen--and into sich nice warm rooms. And\nwhat's more, yer can go on till yer are as old as old--as a costume\nmodel anyway. Of course, while you're young, the sun shines, and yer\nbucks up and makes yer 'ay accordin'. Yer can earn pounds a week\nsometimes, quite easy. Look at me--I'm a middle-aged one now, yet I\nmakes a pretty fair livin' by it, and don't overwork myself neither.\"\n\n\"How would I start to get work? Is it difficult to get up a connection?\"\ninquired the girl dubiously.\n\n\"Not for the likes of you. You'd only 'ave to show yerself. But yer\nstill looks ill, and you're ever so weak. You've got to be strong to\n'stand,' I can tell yer. 'Tain't no use beginnin' yet. I wish we could\ngit yer away to the seaside.\n\n\"I'll get well quickly in London now--I will really. I'll go out into\nthe parks every day for fresh air, and be as strong as ever I was in no\ntime. You shall see.\"\n\nShe duly followed this prescription, with the result prophesied. It had\nbeen inexpressibly painful to feel that she was being maintained by this\nhard-working old woman, upon whom she had not the slightest claim, and\nat the same time to doubt her power of ever making due recompense. Now,\nwith a mind at ease once more as to the future, the open air, the rest,\nand the ample though simple diet were free to fulfil their good work. In\nless than a fortnight Mrs. Harbert was able to declare her _prot\u00e9g\u00e9e_ to\nbe blooming as a rose, and a picture unpainted.\n\nAccordingly she set about finding an engagement for the girl, and one\nmorning, a week or two later, she watched Evarne set off for an advanced\nand important Art school, armed with good courage, a packet of\nsandwiches and some sage advice.\n\n\"Nobody guesses it's yer first sittin', me dear, and nobody won't take\nno notice of yer if yer don't tell 'em. Walk out of the dressin'-room as\nbold as brass, and grumble under yer breath at the pose the master\nchooses, no matter what it is. If you won't come when 'e calls, or run\nback agin, or act the fool in any way what ain't usual with models,\nthey'll all remember you're a human bein', and stare at yer, anxious to\nknow what's the matter. Then, likely enough, you would feel rather put\nout of countenance.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to be silly at all,\" Evarne had declared with conviction;\nand sure enough, when she returned in the evening she was able to state\nthat the entire day had gone off satisfactorily.\n\nShe had not expected to be much troubled by inopportune bashfulness, and\nwhen she found herself again in a studio, beheld the easels and\ndrawing-boards, canvases and palettes, smelt the characteristic odours\nand heard the familiar artistic jargon of the students, she had felt\nherself to be an acolyte in a temple wherein was worshipped the\nperpetuation of the beautiful. The influence of modern thought and\ncustom had fallen from her with her garments, and she had adored her own\nfairness.\n\n\"I'm sorry if it sounds immodest,\" she confessed, \"but indeed I only\nfelt happy to be in the atmosphere of Art once more. I knew that those\nyoung men, who all seemed so much in earnest, would learn much from\npainting me--for it was a very charming pose--and somehow I felt\ninterested in everyone, and as if I wanted them all to get on, and was\nglad to be able to help them to progress a little. Oh, Mrs. Harbert!\nSomehow I feel that if only I came across a real artist--a grand man,\nyou know, but young, who hadn't found himself yet, so to speak--I could\ninspire him to do such wonderful work, to paint pictures he had never\ndreamed of before. I don't fancy I should ever have been much of an\nartist myself, even if I'd been able to keep on--perhaps I should\nthough! Anyhow, I know I have got something in my heart or mind, or\nsomething vague of that sort, that I could give out to another if he\ncould receive it, and had some of the impulse I'm talking about of his\nown, and then he would be able to do what otherwise he would never be\nable to do.... I am getting dreadfully incoherent, but I know what I\nmean myself. Did you ever feel anything like what I've been describing?\"\n\nThe old woman would not commit herself to a direct answer.\n\n\"It's a blessing yer looks at it in that light,\" she commented.\n\nBut nothing could possibly have surpassed Mrs. Harbert's real opinion of\nthe importance of the part played by the model in the production of any\npicture of worth, so she was fully sympathetic, no matter to what\nheights the girl might soar on the topic.\n\nAnd now Evarne found that she had indeed alighted upon a profession in\nwhich she had little to fear for competition, neither did she require\nmuch more aid from Mrs. Harbert. Before her fortnight at the Art school\nwas completed, she had already obtained another engagement.\n\n\"It's the elder sister of one of the young men,\" she explained\ngleefully.\" The youth seems to have waxed somewhat enthusiastic about\nme; so much so that his sister, who is an artist, came down to the\nschool to see the wonder with her own eyes. She wants me to start\nsitting for her next Monday. Am I not fortunate? She seemed such a nice\nwoman, and her brother says she paints beautifully. I am so pleased\nabout it.\"\n\nAnd this success was only the beginning. Ere long Evarne found herself\nthe proud recipient of more offers than she could possibly accept.\nAllowing herself to be guided by the experienced Mrs. Harbert, she\ndiscriminated among them, and also gradually raised her terms.\nNevertheless, work continued to flow in unceasingly; very rarely was\nthere even half a week day that she could regard as a holiday.\n\nAs time passed she became quite well known in the artistic world, and\nsometimes even fulfilled particularly well-paid engagements out of\nLondon. Not only was the girl absolutely delightful to the eye, both in\nface and form, but many an artist found her presence in his studio to be\nstrangely valuable. It was her sympathy with any aspiring worker--the\nkeen interest she took in the picture on hand--quite as much as her\nquick understanding, her almost intuitive divination of its creator's\nideas, unexpressed thoughts and half-conceived fancies, that gave her a\nunique power that the painters themselves were quick to feel. Her own\nartistic instincts and her studio training had given her the gift of\nfalling easily and instinctively into poses full of grace and\nexpression. Quite frequently too, studying the half-completed work,\nideas would come to her which, with a gentle diffidence, she would\nsuggest--usually to find her thought taken advantage of to the vast\nbenefit of the picture. Unquestionably Evarne had found her vocation at\nlast.\n\nHad she been plunged into the career of a model immediately upon leaving\nher petted, luxurious life with Morris Kenyon, she would probably have\nconsidered it as a truly miserable lot--and herself as a victim of cruel\nfate. But her descent in the social scale had been so gradual, and had\nled to such an abyss of abject poverty and humiliation before she had\nalmost groped her way into the next world by the gateway of starvation,\nthat this new existence shone brightly by comparison.\n\nOccasionally she would smile just a little bitterly on comparing her\nearly dreams of artistic fame with the reality of settling down\ncontentedly enough to serving as a mere accessory in the production of\npictures. But she had never been genuinely ambitious, and the pang was\nnot severe. Besides, the counsels of Socrates could step in at such\nmoments, and bring contentment and resignation. Poverty she feared and\nhated, but now that came not near her. True, sweet luxury was also but a\nmemory of the past, but she was well able to live in perfect comfort.\n\nThe five years that followed her adoption of this new profession were\nsuccessful, prosperous, and, in their way, happy. Her beauty was not of\nthe type that wanes with girlhood--each year brought added graces. Her\npath through life was encompassed with affection, good-will, regard. She\nmade a circle of acquaintances for herself--bohemian, but bright, kindly\nand amusing. In every studio she entered she was admired instantly and\nrespected ere long. Both men and women artists were considerate and\nfriendly towards the stately young model, and this was all that she\ndesired.\n\nIn those five years more than a few men fell captive beneath her subtle\ncharm, but never a one could gain her love, and she ruthlessly made it\nclear that she regarded unwanted masculine devotion as the most useless\nand undesirable thing on earth. Neither did the wealth and good position\nof at least one of her honourable suitors affect her. Evarne was true to\nher heart, as she had ever been.\n\nShe was unfailing in friendship and gratitude towards the old woman to\nwhom she owed so much of her present calm contentment. Very speedily she\nhad discharged her monetary debts to Philia--for so she affectionately\nabbreviated Mrs. Philadelphia Harbert's somewhat ponderous first\nname--but that was not all.\n\nHer first upward step had been to move into a couple of rooms in a\nneighbouring house, furnishing them gradually in a manner pleasing to\nher taste. After a year or so she grew ambitious, and inviting Philia to\njoin forces with her, migrated to Chelsea. There she took a little house\nin a poor yet eminently respectable street. Her new domain had a tiny\ngarden in front, a yet tinier grass plot behind, and contained four\nrooms and a kitchen. True, there was no room for the proverbial swinging\nof a cat, but Evarne was touchingly proud of her little home, and spent\nmoney upon its furnishing with truly extravagant abandon.\n\nOld Philia's engagements as a model had for years past been somewhat\ndifficult to obtain, and as Evarne waxed wealthier, so Philia had fallen\ninto low water. It was accordingly arranged between them, on their first\ndeciding to live together, that when the elder woman was actually\nearning money she should pay somewhat towards the expenses of their\njoint establishment. At other times it was to be regarded as fully\nequivalent if she undertook to prepare breakfast and supper for Evarne,\nthe principal breadwinner and rent-payer; to superintend the labour of\nthe occasional charwoman, and generally to see to the little home being\nkept neat and clean and cosy.\n\nAs time passed, Philia almost entirely abandoned posing, and devoted\nherself to domestic labours. Evarne delighted in being looked after,\ntended and made much of, so she was well content with this state of\naffairs. As to Philia, she found herself absolutely happy in her old\nage, and was given to quoting imaginary passages from Shakespeare\nlargely, to show that her first disinterested kindness towards her poor\nyoung upstairs neighbour had been as bread cast on the waters, which was\nnow returning itself in the form of cake.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\n\n                             IN ARTIST-LAND\n\n\nOne winter morning the monotony of the studio in which Evarne was posing\nwas broken by the unannounced entrance of a young man.\n\nMr. Towning, the owner of the domain, threw down his palette, and\ngreeted the newcomer heartily.\n\n\"Why, it's Hardy! Haven't seen you for ages, old chap.\"\n\n\"Up to my eyes in work. And I see you're hard at it too. Don't let me\ninterrupt business.\"\n\nThus adjured, Towning recommenced his interrupted occupation, while his\nvisitor stood by and scrutinised his labours.\n\n\"You're making a fine thing of that,\" was the verdict. \"The\ncolour scheme is delightful--absolutely. That touch of blue just\nthere--splendid! I say, what a splendid model you've got.\"\n\nTowning lowered his voice a trifle.\n\n\"Yes, and that touch of blue was her suggestion, if you please. What do\nyou think of that? Have you not seen her before--Evarne Stornway?\"\n\n\"Oh, is that who it is? Of course I've heard of her. Only last week some\nchap was in to see Geoff, and he fairly raved over her. By Jove, he\nwasn't far wrong either.\"\n\n\"She's quite uncommon, isn't she? It's not often one finds a glorious\nshape like that, more's the pity. By the way, what's Geoff Danvers\nworking at now?\"\n\n\"He's off to Venice at the end of March. He's going to paint abroad till\nnext winter.\"\n\n\"Lucky dog. It's all right to have plenty of money, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But there are not many who use it as Geoff does. Heaven knows what I\nshould do without him, and now he is not going alone to Venice.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"He's taking two young chaps, Melcarp and Thorpe, with him. It will be\nthe time of their lives. They haven't got a spare penny piece between\nthem, and could as easily have taken themselves to study in the moon as\nin Italy. Geoff is paying all their expenses, and making out that it's a\nfavour on their part that they're coming. Vows he would die of dulness\nwithout company. Melcarp and Thorpe are half off their heads with\nexcitement.\"\n\n\"Lucky beggars. What will you do when he's gone?\"\n\n\"Oh, plod along in the studio as usual. I have got a fine idea for a\npicture, and I am hunting for a model. The subject is a couple of lines\nof Keates's 'Belle Dame sans Merci,' and I want a girl with\nreddish-golden hair and a palish face; gleaming eyes, deep set; and\ncruel red lips--all curves. Not a fine bouncing wench at all, but one of\nthose weird, fascinating, fragile sort of women--you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"But you surely don't expect to find exactly what you want?\"\n\n\"Scarcely. But if I could only get the right  hair with the pale\nface it would be something. To tell the truth, Towning,\" the young\nartist avowed, with a moment's outburst of confidence, \"I haven't got as\nmuch imagination as an artist really wants. I don't get a clear vision\nof things in my mind; I just get a shadowy sort of notion. But unless I\ncan have some degree of reality before me, very similar to my vague\nfancy--well, I am nowhere. My idea just dies away.\"\n\n\"Paint portraits. There's more money in that than in anything else, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Oh, that reminds me of a bit of real luck. When Lord Winborough returns\nto England in the autumn, he has promised to let me do a bust of him to\nexhibit. Splendid chance, isn't it? But I am awfully set on doing that\n'Belle Dame' picture.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Miss Stornway knows of a girl with red-gold hair and all the\nrest of it. By the way, it's time.\"\n\nHe ceased working, and slightly nodded to Evarne. She stood up,\nstretched her arms over her head, gave a couple of tiny kicks to take\nthe stiffness from one of her knees, then slipped behind the screen that\nformed a temporary dressing-room. She reappeared, clad in a loose\ncrimson wrapper, and sat down by the fire.\n\nThe young men joined her.\n\n\"You heard what we were talking about, of course, Miss Stornway?\"\nquestioned Towning. \"Is there a 'Belle Dame' among your friends?\"\n\nBut Evarne was unable to render assistance. She knew of two models with\nred-gold hair, but the accompanying round, rosy faces and _retrouss\u00e9_\nnoses of both were in no way mystic and interesting. All she could do\nwas to promise to remember the requirement, and to send any likely\ndamsel along for inspection.\n\n\"Thank you. But you're about the fiftieth person who's on the lookout,\"\nreturned Jack Hardy ruefully.\n\nWhen he finally took his departure, he walked slowly back to Kensington,\na cloud of discontent upon his brow. His mind was full of his picture,\nthe great work he was longing to commence, yet--morbidly conscious of\nhis own limitations--he was resolutely determined not to start without\nhaving found a suitable model for the central figure.\n\n\"I _must_ get on! I _must_ make headway! All my youth is passing!\"\n\nHe almost snarled these words aloud. Earnest, enthusiastic, patiently\nhard-working, Jack Hardy was devoid of one spark of divine inspiration,\nand knew it but too well for his peace of mind. He saw his own handiwork\nwithout gloss or glamour; viewed it as it was in stern reality, good in\ncomposition, in technique, but commonplace--oh! Phoebus Apollo and all\nye Muses--how sadly commonplace! Not a man or woman, trained and\npractised as he was, but could have done equally well. In the ripest\nfruit of his hand and brain there was absolutely nothing individual;\nscarce a trace of originality; no magnetism, no grip. Never had Jack\nHardy completed a work, and looking upon it said within himself: \"None\nbut I could have produced just this result. Only the combination of\nheart and brain and soul and knowledge that makes Me could have evolved\nthis picture. I myself am in it.\"\n\nAs a student, a great future had been prophesied for him, and in those\ndays he had believed in himself. But time had glided by, his thirtieth\nyear was past, his powers had matured without enlarging their scope, and\nwith bitter reluctance he commenced to realise that he now saw the full\nextent to which his capacity would ever attain. He might become more\ncertain, more facile, but nothing else. No longer could he still look\nforward and upward, confident in what would be revealed when the summit\nof the hill he so laboriously climbed was reached. He was there, and lo!\nit was but the crowded tableland of mediocrity!\n\nHis thoughts were bitter as he walked through the streets that day. Why\nhad Nature so utterly denied him that divine \"something\" that no\nindustry can give, no study can acquire? \"I can but despise my own men\nand women,\" he thought. \"I am no creator! I make forms in paint, but I\ncannot give them the breath of life. I make them beautiful--strictly\nspeaking--yet there is no beauty in them. I am a craftsman, a\nmechanic--not an artist.\"\n\nBut he had a stout heart and a dogged obstinacy that refused to yield.\nSurely this fervid ambition to abandon himself to imaginative work must\nbe the outcome of some fire of inspiration, however small and\nsmouldering. Let him only find that woman with the gleaming pale face\nand the sunlike hair, and he surely could and would produce his\nmasterpiece.\n\nHe looked around as he walked. Even if he discovered his personified\ndream out of the ranks of professional models, he meant to leave no\nstone unturned to persuade her to sit for his great picture.\n\nHe shivered somewhat as the chill winter blasts rushed by. Money was far\nfrom plentiful in Jack's pockets. In true artistic style he inhabited a\ngarret in Bohemia, and it was only by the strictest economy that he was\nenabled to exist on the work he sold, aided by the small sum of money he\nhad inherited from his mother.\n\nYet the studio belonging to the top suite in the handsome block of flats\nthat he entered, and in which he was obviously quite at home, bore every\nsign of ample wealth. A spacious and lofty apartment, it was obviously\nno makeshift, but had been destined by its architect to behold artistic\nlabours. This was clearly shown by its top-lights, and its one very huge\nwindow, unusually wide and deep.\n\nFrom the front entrance of the flat of which it formed part, this studio\nwas reached by crossing a wide hall, on the left side of which opened\nthe living-rooms of the suite. But the entire right-hand half of the\nflat, looking north, was devoted to the requirements of Art. At the\nfarther end of the studio itself a door opened on to a short passage on\neach side of which was a quite small room. That on the right was the\nmodel's dressing-room; it communicated also directly with the studio,\nbut the other little room had its only opening into the short corridor.\nIt was destined for the storing of plaster and other materials used in\nmodelling, and possessed the useful addition of a tiny sink with hot and\ncold water. A door at the farther end of the dividing passage gave\naccess to a flight of stairs which ultimately led out to Langthorne\nPlace, where was the back entrance of the block of flats.\n\nThe studio itself was verily a fascinating spot, with its exquisite\nreplicas of classical statues; its curious swords and armour; its\nplaques; its Damascus shawls and Eastern draperies; divans and lavishly\ncarved chairs and tables. Vases of curious build, harmonious outline, or\nrich colour stood around, several--despite the wintry season--filled\nwith pink and crimson roses.\n\nBut for all this luxury, it was obviously a workshop. The scent of the\nflowers struggled feebly through the stronger odour of oils and\nturpentine, while a couple of the vases were utilised to hold spiky\nclusters of innumerable paint-brushes. The statue of Venus was next to\nthe life-sized lay figure; the Salviati mirror reflected, besides a\nbronze Mercury, a grim skeleton and a plaster cast of a head with the\nouter skin removed to show the facial muscles. Numerous studies and\nunfinished sketches decorated or defaced the walls, while heavy-looking\nbooks on anatomy and perspective were to be found by the side of\ndaintily-bound poets and some of the newest novels. There was quite\nenough of dust and disorder to show this _atelier_ to be the haunt of\nearnest workers, and the young man, clad in a much-besmeared painting\noverall, who stood before a large canvas, scarcely glanced aside as Jack\nentered.\n\nIn this industrious artist Jack beheld his best and truest friend. It\nwas to the good-nature of Geoffrey Danvers that he owed the privilege of\nworking in this splendid studio from morning to evening, and making it\npractically his home; it was Geoff's generosity that freed him from any\ndifficulties concerning the cost of canvas, colours and models.\n\nMeeting at an Art school in Paris, a close comradeship had sprung up\nbetween the two young Englishmen, and when Geoff returned to London and\ntook up his abode in this flat with its fine studio, he was not slow in\nsuggesting that Jack Hardy should continue to be his brother-in-art.\n\nHe knew his friend's poverty, knew that without some such help he would\nbe condemned to waste many of his days turning out \"pot-boilers,\" and\nwas heartily glad to be able to save him from this embittering\nemployment. For the present, at all events, Jack was quite freed from\nevery expense connected with his work. He procured all his materials\nfrom Geoff's colour dealer, and never even saw the bills, while each\nweek the fee for his model got itself paid in the same convenient\nmanner.\n\nBut money was indeed scarcely an object to Geoff. He was possessed of\nfar more than enough for the simple life that was his choice. He really\ncould not see that any unusual kindliness or generosity lay in his\nfavourite diversion of playing \"fairy godfather\" to other young artists,\nclever yet needy. All his aspirations for the future, all his interest\nin the present, lay in Art--his life's occupation--and he pursued it\nwith a devotion, an ardour, that could not have been surpassed had he\nknown his whole ultimate welfare to depend upon his success.\n\nAnd surely the gods loved Geoffrey Danvers! Not only did he bring to his\nlabours a brain in which the capacity for unwearying endeavour\nco-existed with ever-active enthusiasm and alert intelligence; more than\nthat--to him had been given an imaginative soul that swam easily and\nalways in a boundless sea of fantasy and dreams. His good right hand\nfollowed instincts, obeyed emotions and upwelling thoughts, all\nunguessed-at and undreamed-of by plodding, heavy-minded Jack Hardy. Thus\ncame forth work pulsating with that power, that appeal, that life, for\nwhich Jack yearned, that he struggled for, prayed for--in vain--all in\nvain.\n\nAn hour later the two young men sat down to lunch. Jack's opening\nstatement was startling.\n\n\"I've seen the most beautiful woman alive.\"\n\n\"That's a big order. Your 'Belle Dame'? No, you couldn't have kept that\ngreat fact to yourself for so long.\"\n\n\"I should think not. No, it's that Miss Stornway whom Flinders spoke of.\nYou remember--the 'Diana' of Montford's last year's Academy picture.\nShe's sitting for Towning now. She is lovely--really. She looks as\nstrong and lithe and graceful as the goddess herself. Never worn corsets\nin her life, I understand. Her face is perfectly exquisite too--pure\nGreek. Her hair waves back from halfway down her forehead, like that of\nVenus there.\"\n\n\"Dark, is she?\"\n\n\"Almost black hair, big brown eyes, quite a brunette really; but one\nmight think she was fair, she has such a clear complexion, such a\nsmooth, satin-like skin. Go out to Towning's and see her. It's really\nworth while.\"\n\n\"We'll have her to sit here. I can see you are anxious to paint from\nher.\"\n\n\"I must confess I am.\"\n\n\"You had better write at once then. Since she is such a paragon of\nbeauty I expect she has a waiting list of engagements.\"\n\nA couple of days later proved Geoffrey to be a true prophet.\n\n\"We have indeed got to wait our turn, it seems. Miss Stornway can't come\nuntil the middle of March,\" announced Jack, studying the response to his\nletter. \"Ten weeks ahead. Why, that is about when you'll be going away.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter at all. If I have got my 'Death of Orpheus'\nfinished I might make a few studies of her, to use up my last few days\nhere; but she is coming for you, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\n\n                            GEOFFREY DANVERS\n\n\nThe spring morning on which Evarne was to make her first appearance in\nthis new studio dawned fresh and crisp. On the outward journey she\npurchased a bunch of daffodils, and slipped them between the revers of\nher warm squirrel coat. A little cap of the same grey fur perched itself\njauntily upon her thick hair, beneath which her clear, calm eyes looked\nforth upon the world with a certain sweet and serene complacency.\n\nShe had allowed herself more than sufficient time for finding her goal,\nand was ushered by an elderly charwoman into an empty studio. She sat\ndown patiently to wait, picking up the day's newspaper to pass the time\nuntil Mr. Hardy should arrive.\n\nGradually the feeling assailed her that she was being watched. At length\nthe conviction became sufficiently strong to cause her to lower her\npaper and look round. There, sure enough, in an open doorway, stood a\nyoung man.\n\nShe rose rather suddenly to her feet. This was presumably Mr. Danvers.\n\n\"Excuse my staring so hard,\" said Geoff rather awkwardly, as he came\nforward. \"I didn't mean to startle you.\"\n\n\"I'm here to be looked at, you know,\" was the smiling retort, and then a\nconfused silence prevailed.\n\nAny embarrassment before strangers was an unusual experience, and Evarne\nfound herself consciously casting around in her mind for something to\nsay.\n\n\"May I put my daffodils into water--I should be sorry to see them fade?\"\nshe asked at length.\n\nFor answer Geoff impulsively seized a bunch of roses by their unhappy\nheads, whipped them out of their vase and flung them aside.\n\n\"Put your flowers here,\" he said.\n\n\"You need not have done that,\" suggested Evarne somewhat reproachfully.\n\"There was plenty of room for my daffodils beside your roses.\"\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n\"Do you believe in omens?\" asked Geoff suddenly.\n\n\"I hardly know,\" was the uninspiring response.\n\nOnce more came a pause of considerable duration. Conversation between\nthese two, neither usually gauche or dull-witted, seemed to consist of\nbrief, somewhat inane remarks, interlarded with long periods of silence.\nBut these protracted intervals were strangely devoid of any unpleasant\nfeeling of restraint.\n\nMeeting Geoffrey's grey eyes fixed full upon her, Evarne instinctively\nsmiled at him, slowly and serenely as was her wont. The young man rose\nfrom his chair with an abrupt start, and, crossing over to his easel,\ncommenced to sort out brushes.\n\n\"I, too, am going to paint from you, Miss Stornway,\" he explained with\nhis back to her, \"but my friend must arrange your pose. He has got an\norder for the picture. I can't think what is keeping him.\"\n\nEven as he spoke Jack swept in like a whirlwind, full of explanations.\n\n\"Have you been here long, Miss Stornway? Well, never mind, only be as\nquick as you can in dressing, there's a good girl. I want you to wear\nthis. Where on earth is it? Have you looked at the costume this morning,\nGeoff?\"\n\n\"Which costume?\"\n\n\"The one you helped me twist up yesterday, of course.\"\n\nFrom the recesses of the plaster-room Jack produced what was apparently\na white rope, but as he proceeded to shake it out, it expanded into a\nloose sleeveless gown. It was made of almost transparent muslin, and had\nbeen damped, twisted round as tightly as possible while still wet, and\nthus left to dry. As a result it was now covered with innumerable little\nfolds and creases, delightfully reminiscent of the draperies of antique\nstatues.\n\nBefore to-day had Evarne worn just such a robe, and knowing that nothing\nwas better calculated to emphasise her commanding beauty than was this\ngraceful simplicity, it was with considerable satisfaction that she took\nit from Jack's hand and retired to the model's room. A white ribbon was\nprovided to confine the falling folds beneath her breast; the only touch\nof colour was the rich blue of the cornflowers and golden yellow of ripe\nwheat-ears that composed a wreath for her head. She did not hurry in the\nleast over her toilette, but took as much time as ever she required in\narranging her hair graciously beneath the light garland, and in\ncarefully coaxing and smoothing into artistic folds the masses of snowy\ndrapery, and moulding it to her form. She felt strangely, unreasonably\nexcited--peculiarly anxious to look her very best for Mr. Hardy's\nbenefit. She gazed at her reflection critically ere leaving her retreat,\nand having an artist's eye, her lips inevitably curved into a soft smile\nof satisfaction.\n\n\"Well, you do look ripping!\" exclaimed Jack impulsively, as she appeared\nand stood motionless for a moment to be surveyed.\n\nGeoff was silent, but Evarne's glance had somehow wandered towards him,\nand his eyes had spoken. Half-unconsciously she gave a tiny happy laugh,\nas, scorning the step, she sprang lightly upon the throne.\n\nNever had a day sped with such magical rapidity. For the first time in\nher whole experience as an artist's model she was genuinely sorry when\ntwilight fell and work had to be abandoned. Strangely, strangely\nattractive was the mental atmosphere of this studio, wherein luxury and\nambition blossomed side by side.\n\nShe had received in her life not a few personal lessons concerning the\nuncertainty of Fate and mutability of Fortune, while from Philia's\nteachings she had learned it all over again second-hand. As the old\nwoman put it--\n\n\"Yer goes out innercent and unsuspectin' for a quiet walk, and perhaps\nyou're brought 'ome on a shutter dead as a doornail, from a chimney-pot\n'avin fallen and cracked yer skull; or you've been squashed by a motor;\nor shot by a lunatic; or bit by a mad dog. All them things 'appens to\nsome folks. Maybe your turn next, maybe mine. Or, more ordinary like, a\nbit o' grit blows into yer eye all in the twinklin' of a second--no\nwarnin' at all--and yer goes gropin' 'arf-blind for the rest of the\nday.\"\n\nEvarne returned home that evening with a metaphorical \"bit o' grit\"\nhaving blown in her eye, \"in a twinkling of a second--no warning at\nall.\" Many a studio had she entered, many an artist had she known,\nclever, young and attractive, who had been kind and considerate to her,\neven as Geoffrey Danvers. What quality did he possess in any superlative\ndegree to mark him out from all others? What was there about him that\nawoke such--well--such a keen and ardent interest in her mind, not only\nfor himself and his work, but for everything with which he was even\nremotely connected? He had not said or done anything at all original or\nparticularly interesting, yet she found herself dwelling upon his every\nword, every action, recalling and musing upon his most casual\nunprofessional glance.\n\nPerhaps, after all, the deep and engrossing impression he had made was\nbut the natural outcome of the ardent admiration she had felt for those\nof his paintings that were still in the studio. Instantly had she\nrealised that here was work of no common order--that there was a\ncombination of charm and of force, an instinct for the dramatic,\ntogether with a certain dreamy mysticism, a poetic treatment of daring\nrealism, that could not possibly have been evolved by a banal,\nuninteresting mind. Surely a man's self can often be better read in his\nworks than by years of ordinary acquaintanceship?\n\nWhen Philia made her usual inquiries regarding the personal appearance\nof these new employers, Evarne had described Jack Hardy well enough, but\nher recollection of Geoff was apparently vague.\n\n\"Well--let me think--he has fair hair, but he is clean-shaven, and he\nwas dressed in light grey.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"There is nothing much to tell, really. He is a bit taller than I am--I\nnoticed that when he stood up on the throne to make some alteration in\nmy wreath. When he is working he wears a painting overall of blue linen,\nwhich betrays vanity.\"\n\n\"Pore young man. Why should yer say that?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he knows the colour suits him. Now, Mr. Hardy only has brown\nholland.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Danvers good-looking?\"\n\nEvarne reflected a moment, then temporised.\n\n\"I thought so,\" she answered.\n\nDays came and passed. A whole week went by, but her mental vision in no\nway recovered its normal equipoise.\n\n\"Whatever 'as took yer, Evarne?\" inquired Philia at supper one evening,\nwhen some blatant act of absent-mindedness proclaimed that her\ncompanion's thoughts were far away. \"There's no tellin' now what you'll\nbe up to next. You're anticking about jist as if you'd fallen in love.\"\n\n\"Fallen in love!\" Evarne had never liked that term; it had seemed to her\nsomewhat cheap and light. But, after all, was it not strangely\ndescriptive--full of realism? Only last week she and \"that other\" had\nbeen total strangers. Now--ah! now--what a difference! Only a few mutual\nglances; a tender pressure of the hand; a stolen smile, so full of\nmeaning--at once the whole world bore a different face, was lit by a new\nglory; all life's hopes and possibilities sprung forth anew, richly\nscented, brightly hued. \"Fallen in love\" indeed! What other imaginable\nphrase could so forcefully express both the suddenness and the personal\nirresponsibility of that which had brought to pass this all-wondrous\nchange?\n\nEvarne pictured love as a seething, rushing torrent. It had nigh drowned\nher in a maelstrom once, but she had scrambled out, and the last drop of\nits cruel waters had long since dried from her garments. Now she had\nwalked quietly along as if on its flat, dull, safe banks for many a\nyear, merely smiling serenely, somewhat scornfully, at those\nwho--dabbling their feet where its eddies were calm and shallow--had\nstretched forth their hands, inviting her to join them in their child's\nplay. But in the fated hour a pair of grey eyes had gazed up at her from\nout the depths of the stream; she had looked a moment too long, too\nintently, and had fallen sheer into the flood and was swept helplessly\nalong in its wild current. Surely it was far safer to retain one's\nbalance always and ever, to keep a steady head and avoid even this\ndivine fall? Mayhap! Yet so far--drifting lightly and unresistingly--she\ncould not regret. The touch of these waters was indeed pleasant; they\ntasted sweet within her mouth. Rocks there were indeed--cruel, menacing\nboulders--yet she came not nigh them. Surely it was better here, far\nbetter, despite dangers cruel and manifold, than on those level arid\nbanks.\n\nA fortnight glided by, and not a day but saw fresh verses added to the\npoem of which these two had, all unconsciously, composed the opening\nstanzas at the very moment of their first meeting. So far this song of\nlove ran in simple cadence--easy of construction and rhythm. Not a line\nhad yet been sent forth into the air. Strophe and antistrophe were sung\nin silence, yet with perfect mutual comprehension and harmony.\n\nNever since those first few minutes--given over to apparent tongue-tied\nembarrassment--had Geoffrey and Evarne been together without Jack making\na third. While this was certainly in the ordinary course of events, it\nwas also, in some degree, the outcome of deliberate design on Jack's\npart. That young man had the greatest fear of love. He viewed it with\napprehension and misgiving, a disease, a madness, to be warded off and\navoided desperately--at all events by an artist. He might not know very\nmuch about the matter, or the symptoms by which it made its terrible\npresence manifest, but very soon indeed he was assailed by an alarming\nsuspicion that Geoff regarded Miss Stornway differently from other\nmodels, dangerously differently.\n\nJack was uneasy. He felt a sort of responsibility for having introduced\nthe young woman into the studio, much as he would have held himself\nguilty had he brought home fever from one of his searches for \"La Belle\nDame,\" and thus prostrated his friend upon a bed of sickness. He had a\nvague idea that his presence might somehow suffice to nip any growing\nfeeling of affection in the bud. Thus he conscientiously hovered around.\n\nAnd Geoffrey--a prey to many conflicting emotions--raised no objection.\nThere were reasons that made it very desirable that he should not grow\nto seriously care for this fascinating model. Not being of a nature that\ncould treat emotional matters lightly, for some time his delight in\nEvarne's presence was largely diluted by an ardent wish that he had\nnever seen her fair face. But this marvellous wisdom did not have things\nall its own way.\n\nThe date was rapidly approaching when he had arranged to leave England.\nGeoff's two young travelling companions were continually dropping in,\nfull of eager talk of the journey and the work that was going to be\naccomplished at Venice. Day by day his gradually growing dislike of this\nproposed absence from London increased.\n\nAt length a mental crisis came. His many conflicting thoughts settled\nthemselves into a resolution.\n\n\"I say, Jack,\" he announced one evening, \"you had better go to Venice\nwith those boys. I have just made up my mind that I'm not going. You can\nbe ready in three days, can't you?\"\n\nJack absolutely gasped.\n\n\"Why not? Why are you not going?\"\n\n\"I prefer to stop in England. I--I--well, I suppose I may as well tell\nyou. There's no reason for secrecy. I've seen the woman I want to\nmarry.\"\n\nJack tried to look mystified and at a loss, as if thereby he could ward\noff the evil hour.\n\n\"Who is it?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Why, you blind old bat, who should it be but--Miss Stornway?\"\n\nThe blow had fallen.\n\n\"Geoffrey Danvers!\" and Jack's voice was full of horror. \"You must not\nbe so idiotic!\"\n\nThe young man laughed lightly as he answered--\n\n\"Object, argue and discuss as much as you like. I'll talk to you for\nhours about her. Why should I not marry that sweet girl? Tell me?\"\n\n\"Well, after all she's only a--only a----\"\n\n\"Only a model! What on earth has that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"It's a very serious objection on earth, whatever it may be in heaven,\"\nretorted Jack, flattering himself he had been rather smart.\n\n\"And don't you know where marriages are made? I tell you she is the one\nwoman Heaven intended for me. Don't think I love her only for her\nbeauty--though she is lovely beyond all words. But if her eyes were\nsmall and squinting, yet had that same beautiful soul shining out of\nthem----\"\n\nJack interrupted. Even his limited imagination was capable of supplying\nthe conclusion of this sentiment.\n\n\"Look here, Geoff! Do see reason.\"\n\n\"I prefer to see Evarne.\"\n\n\"But you cannot--you must not--marry an artist's model whom you haven't\nknown for three weeks----\"\n\n\"That's a mere detail. It's my misfortune, isn't it, not my fault, that\nI didn't meet her years ago? As to her being a model--what of it? It's\nan honest enough profession when a girl is obliged to earn her own\nliving, and you know when her father died and left her penniless she had\nto do something. Everybody knows that needlework is a starving\noccupation, and I think that old woman who suggested her taking up this\nbusiness was a paragon of wisdom. There's nothing at all in Miss\nStornway's life that anyone could take exception to, unless they were\nutterly bigoted. You can't find any story to her discredit in any\nstudio, or on the lips of any artist. Everyone speaks well of her, she\nis entirely admirable--brave, beautiful----!\"\n\n\"Oh, she's a nice girl enough, and I don't doubt she's straight as a\ndie. But don't--don't rush into this affair madly and hastily. You were\ngoing to Venice. Well, for goodness' sake go.\"\n\n\"I will, later on, and take Evarne with me. I say, I take it all very\nmuch for granted, don't I? But she does care for me--you think she does,\neh?\"\n\nJack discreetly suppressed the retort that rose to his lips.\n\n\"How can I tell? But, of course, I meant go alone to Italy, to test the\nreality of your feelings. Six months out of a lifetime--why, it's\nnothing, if it be really an affair for a lifetime. And if absence shows\nit to be but a passing fancy--well, you will have done no harm to her or\nto yourself.\"\n\n\"If I didn't see her for twenty years, I should never change, never\nforget her.\"\n\n\"And it's only six months that's in question. If she really is the woman\nabove all others for you, then, I'd say, make her your wife even if she\nwere a beggar in the streets. But be sure first, Geoff! You're\ntwenty-six now--not a hot-brained boy. Do submit your fancy to this\nsmall test before you fly in the face of society. You know what a\ngeneral row there will be, and how all your own set will disapprove. You\nare the heir to a title, though you never seem to remember it, so that\nyour marriage is a matter of real importance.\"\n\n\"I've thought of all that. Don't think I've overlooked any of the\narguments my family would be sure to bring up. But I am not going to let\nmy vague prospects make any serious difference in my life. Why, I dare\nsay the title will never come to me. Winborough quite easily might live\nlonger than I.\"\n\n\"It's hardly likely since he's about a quarter of a century older.\nAnyway, there's the possibility, not to say the likelihood, that your\nwife will one day find herself a countess, and that your son will be the\nfuture Earl of Winborough. It really is no light matter, old fellow.\nDon't disappoint these boys; go to Venice with them, and see how you\nfeel toward Miss Stornway when you come back.\"\n\n\"And have some other lucky beggar with more gumption carrying her off in\nthe meanwhile?\"\n\n\"If she married anyone else in six months it would most certainly prove\nthat she had not got the same true depth of feeling for you that you\nhave for her. You ought to be sure, both of yourself and of her, before\nyou make her your wife.\"\n\nThus Jack continued, arguing and discussing, talking the profoundest of\ncommon sense, yet with enough of sympathy to add weight to his words.\nAnd again Geoffrey saw the dark side of the shield, noticed the shadows\nathwart the roseate path. Finally he resolved not to alter his plans for\nthe summer. Six months would soon be gone, and the passing of this time\nof test would sweep the last lingering scruples from his mind.\n\n\"It is a serious matter, and ought to be treated seriously. I'm glad\nI've resolved to go,\" was his ultimate conclusion.\n\n\"I shall often write to you, Evarne,\" he declared, holding the girl's\nhands as they bade each other farewell. \"You will answer my letters,\nwon't you?\"\n\nShe did not look up, not able to trust herself to meet his eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied very meekly, yet gloriously gladdened at heart. \"I\nwill write if you wish me to.\"\n\nImpulsively Geoffrey bent down and kissed first one of the hands he held\nand then the other. Thus they parted.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\n\n                             SEKHET SMILES\n\n\nUntil the end of the week Evarne posed for Jack Hardy alone. She had now\nacquired an entirely fresh interest and new importance in that young\nman's eyes, and he exerted himself to amuse and cheer her during these\nearly days of separation. Geoffrey was not much mentioned between them.\nPrudence on the one side, and an instinctive restraint on the other,\nprevented this. Nevertheless, Evarne was conscious of an added loss when\nshe left this studio to sit for a woman artist, and her surroundings\nwere no longer imbued with the magnetism of the absent one.\n\nBut letters from Geoff promptly proceeded to rain down upon her. Within\ntwenty-four hours of his quitting London came a brief note, and\napparently his first act on reaching Venice was to write to her for the\nsecond time.\n\n\"I shall let four full days go by before I answer,\" she decided. But ere\nthat time had passed, a third very lengthy epistle had arrived, which\nconcluded with the gentlest of reproaches for her unkind negligence in\nnot replying sooner. Thus, when she did sit down after supper one\nevening to write her first letter to Geoffrey, many pages covered with\nhis handwriting were spread out before her gaze.\n\nThe correspondence thus commenced rapidly developed into the most\nengrossing, enthralling, and delightful feature in the existence of\nthese two. They exchanged ideas, sympathies, experiences, hopes and\nfears; and their uttermost frankness on any and every subject but served\nto show with increased emphasis how harmonious were their innermost\nnatures, how naturally their minds trod the same paths.\n\nBoth wrote well and easily, although for some time Evarne, with true\nfeminine discretion, retained a firm grip upon the too frank display of\nthe strength of her affection for Geoffrey. But the days in which she\nforbade her written words to adequately express what she felt were very\nspeedily left behind. As to the young man himself, all his cautious\nscruples had exhausted themselves in leading him out of England. From\nthe first he was troubled by few restrictions, and within a month he was\navowedly writing love letters.\n\nHe had never made any abrupt and startling declaration of his feelings,\nlet alone of his intentions. It was just a case of swift yet easy\ndrifting. He appeared to deem it a matter of course that Evarne knew and\nrecognised the fact that he loved her, and that all else was to be taken\nfor granted. She was both amused and attracted by this simple and\nunobtrusive change in their correspondence from comparative formality to\ntender truth. She expressed no surprise, but took it all quietly and\nwithout comment. Indeed, it seemed really but a natural and ordinary\nthing that she and Geoffrey should acknowledge their love. It was a\ncontinuance of a pretence of mere friendship between them that would\nhave seemed extraordinary. To abandon any disguise was not only easy and\ncomforting--it was instinctive.\n\nThus all those fresh vague thoughts, those dominating and ardent\nemotions that love brings into being, and which suppression causes to\ntorture the brain wherein they are conceived, were granted free scope\nand outlet in the heart-to-heart letters that they wrote so gladly one\nto another. And their love grew and strengthened steadily from this use\nand outgiving.\n\nIt had been some time before Evarne had got to the point of responding\nwith equal frankness to Geoff's ardent epistles, but she did arrive at\nlast.\n\n\"You tell me to think of you, Geoff,\" she sat happily writing one\nevening. \"I do, indeed I do, remember you as steadily as even you\nyourself could possibly desire. To say I think of you every hour is not\nenough--you are never out of my mind or my heart, night and day. I don't\nmean that I think actively and consciously of you _quite_ all the time,\nbut the sense of your personality, the deep thought of you, is\n_incessantly_ with me. It has become a part of my mind, I fancy; for I\nthink of you without realising it, simultaneously with thinking\ndeliberately of other matters.\n\n\"Have no fear. I love you--love you utterly! I never seem to get tired\nnow, however long the day; for the hours fade into nothingness in dreams\nof you. You know how ready all we lazy models are to jump down from the\nthrone directly 'time' is called? Now I often surprise people by not\nmoving when the magic word is spoken. I have not heard it, for I have\nbeen--where?--out in Venice--or in Paradise--I know not; but wherever\nthe place may be, I have been with you! How, then, can I be expected to\nhear, unless people shout to startle me back to earth? In the 'rests' I\nread as usual, or, to be exact, not as usual; for often on reaching the\nend of a page I become aware that I know nothing at all of what it is\nabout--the thought of you, my dear tormentor, has come 'twixt me and the\nwords, and for very shame's sake I have had to start again and try to\nbanish you for just a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Whatever you find to say to Mr. Danvers is more than I can make out,\"\ndeclared Philia, as Evarne, having completed writing her letter,\nproceeded to put its pages into order. \"You scribbles sheets and sheets,\nand every day almost--why, you writes books, and 'e's as bad. If I was\nthe postman I wouldn't 'ave it! Now, jist look at the size of that\nbilly-do.\"\n\nThe young woman made a little grimace.\n\n\"It is rather long, isn't it? But the difficulty does not lie in finding\nwhat to say. It is in obliging one's self to stop.\"\n\n\"Are you goin' to marry 'im, Evarne?\"\n\n\"I--I suppose that is an allowable question? I don't.... No! I\nbelieve--how can I tell? I never think of anything ahead.\"\n\n\"Give me somethin' I can swoller better'n that. 'Ow startled you look.\nWhat's to prevent?\"\n\n\"Marrying! That's--oh, he will marry someone of his own rank.\"\n\n\"Go on with yer. Ain't you a laidy--a perfect laidy, says I?\"\n\n\"I'm an artist's model. Nothing more nor less,\" was the somewhat\nhaughtily spoken rejoinder.\n\n\"Then I 'opes to goodness you'll be careful what yer writes. It's a\njolly dangerous game, I tell yer, puttin' silly talk into writin' and\nthen chuckin' it into the pillar-box. Lord only knows what may come to\nit before it's safely burned or tored up.\"\n\nEvarne smiled.\n\n\"You unromantic old dear! What harm do you think can come of it?\"\n\n\"'E could spoil your chance, if 'e was so minded, with any other\ngentleman as might want to marry yer.\"\n\n\"That doesn't frighten me. Is there nothing else?\"\n\n\"'Ow can I tell? I ain't no Mother Shipton. But I knows well enough it\nain't a wise thing for a girl to do. There ain't a day as passes without\nreckless letters making trouble for someone or other.\"\n\n\"Is it an equally unwise proceeding for men too?\"\n\n\"Yes, my gosh, it jist is. Never 'eard of breach o' promise cases?\nNobody didn't ought to trust nobody in this 'ere wicked world. If yer\ncontents yerself with jist speaking like an idjit, you can always deny\nit afterwards----\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"But when you've bin and gorn and acted like a born natural, by puttin'\nthe stuff into writin', well, 'tain't no use denying it then. You're\ndone for. 'Out damned lines'--Shakespeare! But they don't come out--not\nfor all the cussin' and swearin' in the world.\"\n\nEvarne laughed outright.\n\n\"That's true enough. I know it, and of course Geoff must know it too.\"\n\n\"Oh, 'e's a hartist. They don't know nothin', none of 'em.\"\n\n\"Geoff knows he can trust me, Philia, and I value and appreciate the\nblessed belief he shows in me by writing as he does. Perfect love\ncasteth out fear of every description. He believes that I shall know the\nright thing to do with regard to his letters, and that I shall ever and\nalways do it.\"\n\n\"It don't need much wit for anyone to know they're safe in your 'ands,\nmy dear. But do you write to 'im jist all that comes into yer 'ead,\ntrustin' 'im to know the right thing to do, and do it?\"\n\n\"Indeed yes--oh yes!\"\n\n\"That's the very frame o' mind as ruins 'undreds o' girls. You git rid\nof it, my dear.\"\n\n\"I won't. I shan't even try. No\"--and a wilful head was shaken\nvigorously--\"I shan't pay any attention to your sage advice, not\nthe--least--little bit. Not trust Geoff absolutely and entirely! Why,\nI'd as soon mistrust myself. Though I ought to know better by now--oh,\nindeed, I ought!\"\n\nBitter thoughts of past blind trust made ridiculous, brought a note of\nanguish to the low, sweet voice. But she went on almost defiantly--\n\n\"I like to write to him recklessly, and without a single thought of\npossible future regret. It pleases me to think that he possesses letters\nof mine that people might say a woman should only have written to the\nman who was to be her husband. I like to feel that he and I are, to a\ncertain extent, in one another's power--dependent each on the other's\nhonour. Through those letters he has seen into the innermost recesses of\nmy soul, in a way that no other human being has done. Think, when you\ntruly love, of the delight that lies in such abandonment. But don't you\ntrouble, Philia. I've not told him everything--not shown him quite the\nfull extent of all I feel for him. There is still plenty in reserve.\nThere remain sealed chambers that will not open readily.\"\n\n\"Well, everyone must go their own ways in sich matters. 'Tain't no use\nadvisin'. Common sense and love never seems to flourish longside o' one\nanother, more's the pity.\"\n\n\"You see, love is not a question of 'reason.' It is just 'unreason.'\nSurely it is better to grasp that truth at once, and so reconcile one's\nself to thinking and acting quite unreasonably?\"\n\n\"Oh, you silly young fool!\" snorted Philia as she lit her candle\npreparatory to retiring to bed.\n\nOn the threshold of the door she stopped and looked back; Evarne was\ngazing across at her with a sweet smile playing around her eyes and\nlips. The old woman shook her fist in the air.\n\n\"You silly young----\" She stopped abruptly, sighed, and shook her head\nportentously. Then in a changed voice: \"My gosh, but 'ow I envies yer!\"\n\nShe banged the door violently, and went slowly upstairs. Evarne remained\nfor a few minutes rapt in deep thought. Then, rousing herself, she\npressed each individual page of her letter to her lips, folded it up\nwith scrupulous care and exactness, and went out to the post.\n\nMany a year had passed since she had known such perfect peace and\nsatisfaction as that which now  and perfumed the routine of her\ndays. Living in the present only, she held in her clasp practically all\nthat is needed for happiness. Since her first success as a model she had\nsuffered no physical deprivation such as had characterised that hateful\nyear spent at needlework, but only now were her emotional and\nintellectual requirements equally and at one time satisfied.\n\nThis voluminous correspondence with Geoff was in every way delightful.\nThey thought and wrote much upon topics not altogether personal, Evarne\nbringing her whole intellect as well as her heart to bear upon the\ncomposition of her letters, and, for the first time for many years,\nrevelling in communion with a mind at least equally as reflective and\nwell-informed as was her own.\n\n\"What should I have done,\" she wondered, as she dropped her letter into\nthe pillar-box, \"supposing that, loving Geoff as I do, he had not cared\nfor me, and had never wanted to write? I should have died! I don't mean\nreally and truly, I suppose, but my heart would have drooped, my hope\nand energy and happiness would have faded. I can never be too grateful\nto him--no, never--for saving me from so much suffering.\" Then she\nsmiled softly. \"Sekhet is gracious and good to me again!\"\n\nShe walked home with that free, light step that betokens unlimited\nvitality and buoyancy of spirit. First-love may be indeed unique,\nunapproachable, but that which is born later in life--the emotion\nspringing from the rich, ripe heart and brain, the ardent affection of\nthe human being in the fullest physical and mental perfection--is every\nwhit as dominating, and it is more inspiring, ample and satisfying than\nthat which came when the heart was young and life a fairy-tale. Evarne\nhad blossomed forth afresh beneath this renewal of love, which had led\nher again from the monotony of shade out into the vivifying heat of the\nsun and the glory of white light.\n\nThe power of intense loving was perhaps her greatest and most perfect\nforce. It was not of the type that can be portioned out into a series of\npetty passions. Since Morris died to her, she had met with none other\nwho held the secret by which to possess himself of that unlimited fund\nof devotion lying dormant and neglected. Some of her best and most\ndesirable years had melted away devoid of all emotional interests, and\nsimply to feel herself loved--to have her long-unneeded capacity for\nloving called again into active use--was all-sufficient to create the\nmost perfect happiness.\n\nHer whole nature reawoke, rejoiced and sang, not merely because her love\nwas returned--though from that certainty sprang triumph and the sweet\nexaltation ever attendant upon this greatest of all possible\nsuccesses--but because she herself once more gave her love lavishly. For\nthe present this was all-sufficient. She rarely thought of what must be\nits result--what ultimate end could be attained. Blinded by the light of\nthe never-setting brilliance that now lit her path, she could see\nclearly only what was close at hand, and that was indeed fair. She would\nnot look backwards over that long stretch of desert-land to where lay\nthat dark and fearful forest, with its hidden morasses, evil haunts and\npoisoned plants through which, led by the hand of Sekhet in cruel mood,\nher track had passed long since. Against her better judgment, against\nher will even, Hope unfurled his wings again within her breast. Why\nendeavour to look forward into the ever-shrouded and unknowable future?\nShe lived only for the present, and in that she rejoiced.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXX\n\n                            A GREAT RESOLVE\n\n\nAt the end of three months she sat again to Jack Hardy. He wrote an\nimploring appeal that she would somehow contrive to spare time for him\njust to put her arms and hands into a wondrous allegorical picture he\nwas painting. She did arrange it, for not only were all Geoff's friends\nher special care, but she wanted to behold that dear studio again. She\nwas also rather curious to see young Frank Pallister, of whom Geoffrey\nhad spoken as sharing it with Jack during its rightful owner's absence.\n\nShe found him to be a rosy, fair-haired, somewhat smartly-clad youth,\nlooking even younger than his twenty careless years. His work was\ndistinctly promising, but at present quite elementary--very much that of\nan Art-student. Still, he was but a boy, and, being fairly well-to-do,\nwould probably not have fretted over his still sadly low standard of\nexecution had he not been goaded onwards by a gadfly of another type\nfrom that by which Jack was so constantly harried.\n\nIn one of the smartest squares in the West-end of London resided a\ncertain dainty damsel with a stern, unreasonable dragon of a father.\nMaudie Meridith, in her seventeen-year-old wisdom, fully agreed with\nPallister that they were both of ample age to be at least engaged--even\nif not actually married. Stern, prosaic dragon of a father begged to\ndiffer. After many prayers, many pleadings, he had given vent to this\nappalling ultimatum--\n\n\"When you can show me your name in the catalogue of any of the big\nexhibitions, my boy, I'll consent to your engagement with this baby.\nOtherwise, you will have to wait until she is actually twenty years of\nage. Cruelty to children, isn't it? Be off with you both, and don't\nbother me again.\"\n\nThe youthful suitor had confided this unheard-of tyranny to Geoff, for\nwhom he cherished an affectionate admiration. The response had been to\nthe effect that if Pallister was wise he would not shoot himself or even\nsink into a decline, but would see about endeavouring to fulfil the\nconditions that would shorten these three years of probation.\n\n\"If, as you say, you are unalterably convinced that Art schools keep you\nback, you had better go and work every day in my studio,\" Geoff had\nwritten. \"It is a big one, as you know, and only Jack Hardy is there at\npresent. You would find him an enormous help to you--but don't bother\nhim, there's a good lad. If you want to try your hand at a picture right\naway, there is ample room on the throne for two models; if you think a\nfew months hard preliminary work would be of most value, you can make\nstudies from Jack's model. Good luck to you in any case.\"\n\nThis kind offer had been accepted, and every morning Pallister\npunctually appeared and painted away steadily for a few hours. He did\nnot know the meaning of real hard work, but under the influence of\nJack's friendly aid and advice he certainly improved week by week.\n\nEvarne found a certain satisfaction in being again in Geoff's own home,\ndespite his absence, and although his name was scarcely mentioned. On\nthe wall was a painting of him done by Jack a year or so previously. It\nwas a marvellously good likeness, although the background and\naccessories were unfinished. Portrait-painting was Jack's _forte_, would\nhe but have believed it.\n\n\"I'm going to smuggle away that picture of Mr. Danvers when you are not\nlooking,\" declared Evarne; whereupon Jack, when he paid her at the\nconclusion of her sittings, smilingly handed her also the canvas in\nquestion already tied up to be taken away.\n\nShe hung it in her room, with a little bracket on either side, whereon\nstood vases which she kept filled with fresh flowers. Night and morning\nshe pressed a gentle kiss upon the painted lips.\n\n\"Come back soon, Geoff--come back soon,\" she once whispered impulsively.\nAnd perhaps her wish was wafted away over land and sea to the City in\nthe Waters, for within four months of leaving England Geoff had endured\nquite sufficient of this test of absence. Thus he wrote:\n\n    \"DEAREST, DEAREST BEYOND ALL EXPRESSION,\n\n    \"I am returning home the day after to-morrow! Sweetest lady that\n    heart ever adored, I am coming back to see you, to breathe the\n    same air with you, to tread the same pavements, to kiss your\n    hands, your lips, your feet.\n\n    \"Will you welcome me? I left England loving you.... I thought,\n    to the uttermost of my capacity. Perhaps it was so then; but now\n    I love you ... oh, infinitely more ... because I think of you\n    always.... your exquisite letters have taught me to know you far\n    more perfectly; and all knowledge, all thinking, leads only to\n    fresh love.\n\n    \"In a way, I shrink from meeting you again. I am fearful now. In\n    you is all the good and true, the pure and beauteous. How can I\n    or any man be worthy of you? Suppose, after a while, I read\n    disappointment in your face?\n\n    \"But be kind to me, gentle and compassionate. I kneel at your\n    feet, and beg you to give yourself to me and to take me for your\n    own, heart and mind and body, for ever and ever. No other woman\n    could ever be my wife, Evarne, for no other woman could I love.\n\n    \"May God bless you!\n\n                                                            \"GEOFF.\"\n\nEvarne let this letter drop on the table, then bowed her head upon it in\nsilence.\n\n\"What--what am I to do?\" she murmured after a long pause, filled with a\nturmoil of mingled bliss and suffering. Had she been perfectly free to\nfollow the promptings of her own heart, not one moment for reflection\nwould have been needed. As it was, a secret indestructible, albeit so\nwell-guarded--seemed to rise up as a hideous, pitiless spectre, bidding\nher set aside any idea of a future spent with Geoffrey.\n\n\"I see now--didn't I know it before?--I ought never, never, to have let\nhim grow to care so much for me,\" she thought, weighed down by genuine\nthough somewhat tardy remorse.\n\nShe saw that utter selfishness had ruled her so far, with the result\nthat now it was not only--not chiefly--her own happiness that was at\nstake, but that of one for whom no sacrifice could be too great to be\nsweet.\n\nIn the abstract, the memory of the three years she had spent with Morris\nKenyon formed no burden upon her conscience. Versed in the secrets of\nher own heart--strong in the certain knowledge of the generous, even if\nmisguided, motives that had prevailed with her--she had been absolved at\nthe bar of her most earnest and sincere judgment from all stain of\ndeliberate doing of evil. How was it possible that she should find cause\nto reproach or condemn herself, remembering that supreme hour of test,\nwhen she had held so loyally fast to her innate convictions of what was\nright and what was not; when she had refused to barter a mockery of love\nfor the reality of continued wealth and protection? She thought, too, of\nher life since then, chaste amid greater temptations than a man would\never realise. Deep in her heart was the feeling that she had been tried\nand not found wanting. Surely, then, she was every whit as fitted as any\nordinarily spotless woman to marry a good man?\n\nStill, so long as the likelihood of such a desire on her part had seemed\nfar remote, she had been firmly convinced that she would never allow\nherself to become a wife with her secret unconfessed. But now she was\nfaced by a problem--a torturing doubt--that was quite unforeseen. Would\nit not be morally a greater wickedness, an additional wrong, should she\nremorselessly shatter such perfect trust; smear and deface the happiness\nof this man who loved her so ardently, revered and honoured her with\nsuch glad confidence?\n\nWas it indeed Honour's command that she should dig up this loathsome,\nlong-buried corpse, to thrust it under those very nostrils wherein it\nwould most stink? Was such a cruel and unscrupulous bowing down to the\nconventional idea of right and wrong unquestionably Love's duty? She had\nnever been much guided by mere convention. Was she to begin now when so\nmuch was at stake? Surely not.\n\nShe started suddenly from her chair in bewilderment and distress, and\ncommenced to pace the room. What ought she to do? Earnestly she tried to\nput all care for herself and for her own desires out of her mind--to\nthink only of Geoff. Setting great importance upon the emotional side of\nlife, she scarcely heeded any difference of position that might exist\nbetween herself and him. Unconscious of his future prospects, believing\nhis marriage to be a matter concerning himself alone, her one doubt and\ndifficulty lay in how best to cope with her hidden past.\n\nReason and common sense bade her guard her secret in silence, now\nand forever. But her feelings told her plainly enough that never\ncould she hope to know perfect peace until she had confessed this\nthing--confessed, implored and obtained forgiveness. But would that not\nbe an end of all peace of mind for Geoffrey--ah, poor Geoff! She had\nlearnt his nature so well. His was a love that gloried in placing the\nbeloved upon a lofty height, there to be crowned with stars and\nworshipped. Could she thrust him out of his paradise?\n\nIf she shattered his natural and spontaneous love, would a fresh type,\nall unknown to him now--that which is founded on pity and kindly\nindulgence--rise from out the ruins? Suppose not? What if that other\nkind of love--tender and divine though it may be--was impossible for\nhim? She did not fear that he would repulse her cruelly and\nscornfully--that he could never do, surely. But suppose his love was\nkilled, while hers remained alive? Ah! Merciful heavens!\n\nWith eyes filled by a sudden horror she stopped short before the\npainting of Geoff that hung upon the wall. Long she gazed, and her wild\nglance grew gentle with unutterable affection--with an almost maternal\nyearning. Would life be endurable were it not henceforth consecrated to\nthis man? Ten thousand times no! Both heart and intellect anguished to\nbe allowed full scope to expend their uttermost capacities in the\nservice of love.\n\nAnd was she not verily endowed with gifts both mental and physical that\nwould enable her to make existence infinitely more delightful, more\nfull, interesting and complete for him, than could possibly be his lot\nwith Art for his sole mistress? Surely herein lay her foreordained\nlife's work? Who could be so cruel, so pitiless, as to wish her to be\nmade an outcast from this her heritage? She stretched forth her hands\nimploringly to the dear pictured face. Would he wish it? Oh, surely not!\nShe felt now that her very cause for existence was explained--she had\ndiscovered the end whereunto she had been created--the duty for which\nshe had been placed on earth, and for the more perfect fulfilment of\nwhich every previous experience of her life, glad or sorry, had been but\nessential preliminary training.\n\nGeoff was sweet-natured indeed, and ever kindly, yet all artistic\ntemperaments need understanding. It would require true insight and\ndiscretion, perchance a deal of patience and forbearance, to render any\nlifelong union naught but an added inspiration, an unfailing stimulus,\nan additional happiness to this now ardent lover. Could there be any\nother woman more fitted to this task than she was herself--more capable\nof taking Geoff's whole existence into her tender keeping, and thereby\nblessing and enriching it day by day?\n\nSurely if he never learnt this--her one and only secret--it would be\nimpotent as if it had no existence? And never would it be revealed to\nhim by outside agency; at least, so far as human foresight could\ndiscern. Who among those who had known the truth in those bygone years\nwas in the least likely to again cross her path? Not a single\nindividual. Surely it would be well for Geoffrey to be so far\ndeceived--to be tricked, and, if necessary, lied to on this one point?\nWould not his ultimate greatest happiness be thereby ensured? Since he\nwished her for his wife, should he not have his will? Looking to her\nunhesitatingly for all the good and true, the pure and beauteous in\nwomanhood--was he to be disillusioned?\n\nLong and earnestly she reflected, endeavouring to weigh impartially and\nfairly every argument favouring confession. If Geoffrey could know,\nwould he deem this secrecy to be her crowning blemish--the greatest,\nmost personal and unforgivable wrong of all? Not if he could read her\nheart, and judge by her motives. Her own welfare was indeed not first in\nher mind. The shielding of his happiness was verily her chief thought.\nAlas, that deception should be necessary for its preservation--yet\nsurely this was so? Alas!  alas!\n\nAt length the final doubt ceased to clamour. The decision had been\nprotracted and difficult. It left her lovely face somewhat drawn and\npale; but in her soft, eloquent eyes gleamed a light almost superhuman\nin its intensity of love and desperate resolution.\n\n\"What would I not do, dare, defy for your sake, my best and dearest?\"\nshe murmured aloud. \"Never, while I have strength and power to ward it\noff, will I bring grief and suffering and agony of mind into your life.\nNever!\"\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\n\n                    JOURNEYS END IN LOVERS' MEETINGS\n\n\nNext morning came another little note from Geoffrey. He would arrive in\nLondon at noon that day. When and where could they meet? Would she come\nto the studio as soon as her day's work was over? Might he come to see\nher, or should they meet out-of-doors somewhere? Anything she\ndecided--though she was implored not to put him off until to-morrow.\nWould she please telegraph?\n\nEvarne looked across the breakfast table.\n\n\"Philia, in what costume do I look nicest of all?\"\n\nThe answer was prompt.\n\n\"You looks nicest of all in yer own skin, and nothin' else.\"\n\nThe girl smiled.\n\n\"But that hardly does for this occasion, all the same. I'm going to\nsupper with--with Geoff.\"\n\n\"Beg yer parding. 'E's really 'ome, then? Wear anythin' yer choose. 'E\nwon't never notice!\"\n\nEvarne feared she was a most restless and impatient model that day. The\nhours seemed interminable. But they were got through somehow, and at\nseven o'clock in the evening she stepped from a hansom and proceeded to\nmount the three flights of broad stairs that led up to the studio. Her\nheart was throbbing so wildly that even before the first landing was\nreached her breath came with difficulty, and a feeling almost of\nfaintness obliged her to stand still for a few moments, to reconquer\nsome degree of calmness.\n\nThe door of Geoff's flat was already wide open, and just within the hall\nstood the young man himself, awaiting her coming. The instant he caught\nthe first glimpse of her approaching, he bounded downstairs and seized\nboth the hands she held out to him.\n\nFor a minute they stood motionless and speechless, more than content to\nonce again feast their eyes upon one another's faces. Then, still\nwithout a word, they mounted the last flight of stairs, holding hands\nlike children, and the door of the flat closed behind them.\n\nThey were alone together for the first time.\n\nEvarne went into the sitting-room. The curtains were drawn, and two\nrose-pink shaded lamps cast a warm, softening glow upon the heavy oak\nfurniture. Calmly enough she took off her hat, carefully stuck in the\npins, and placed it on a chair. Then she turned round suddenly, and all\nher wealth of hidden feeling quivered in her voice.\n\n\"Oh, Geoff, Geoff! How sweet beyond words it is to see you again!\"\n\nIn a second his arms were around her, and she was strained to his breast\nwith a force that was almost painful. In silence he looked, eagerly and\nintently, deep into the limpid brown eyes so near his own. Such\nineffable tenderness and devotion frankly answered his ardent, searching\ngaze, that the force of his worship for this beautiful woman grew not\nonly unspeakable, but nigh too overwhelmingly great to be borne. His\nbrows contracted, and all unconsciously he uttered a deep-breathed \"Oh!\"\nthat bordered on a groan of pain; then suddenly sinking on his knees\nbefore her with the abandon of his artistic temperament, he seized both\nher hands, covering them with kisses. At last, pressing her soft palms\nhard against his cheeks, he rested motionless, and scarcely could she\nhear his murmured broken words--\n\n\"How I adore you! I can scarcely endure it. You are more perfect even\nthan I remembered. Evarne! Evarne!\"\n\nShe was already bending slightly forward, for unconsciously he was\ndragging her hands downwards. She leant lower, and lightly brushed his\nfair hair with her lips. A divan was close by. She sank down, and, still\nkneeling, Geoffrey rested his folded arms upon her knees and looked up\ninto her face.\n\nThe turmoil of strong emotion was still so far beyond all possible\nexpression, that to both speech could have been merely a mockery. For a\nprotracted period nothing was said in spoken words. When Evarne finally\nbroke the long silence it was with tones so soft, so appealing, that\nthey were in themselves a gentle caress, although the actual words were\ncommonplace enough.\n\n\"You won't leave me again? You won't go away any more?\"\n\n\"Not without you, my dearest, my dearest! Never shall I go without\nyou--no, not even to the end of the street--if I can persuade you to\ncome with me.\"\n\n\"And I would follow you willingly, whatever might await us at the end of\nthe street.\"\n\n\"You really love me?\"\n\n\"You want to hear my voice tell you what you know so well already?\"\n\nGeoff answered only with his eyes. Evarne put out both hands and drew\nhis head to her bosom, pressing it so tightly that he felt the throbbing\nof her heart against his cheek. After a minute the gentle whisper\nfloated to his ears--\n\n\"I loved you yesterday. I love you to-day, and I shall love you\nto-morrow.\" After a little pause she added, \"I'll tell you something\nmore too.\"\n\n\"Nothing else seems to matter. Still, do tell me!\"\n\n\"It's just a little nothing. Only this--that I cared for you before you\never cared for me.\"\n\n\"No, 'twas just contrariwise! It's no use to shake your perverse darling\nhead. I can prove it.\"\n\n\"You mean you can try.\"\n\n\"Now, listen. Remember that I saw you before you ever saw me. You were\nreading the paper, but I was reading your face. I had loved you for at\nleast three full minutes before you ever beheld me. How now?\"\n\nEvarne laughed happily.\n\n\"Yes, you have won after all. Do you know, I like so much to be told\nthat your gaze was never coldly critical, or even indifferent to me.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine love that does not come at first sight,\" declared Geoff\nwith enthusiasm. \"Not in all its full force and power, naturally, but at\nleast as an immediate conviction that here at length is the one who is\nto become dearest in the whole world. Yet one hears of people knowing\neach other for years before they learn to love. Isn't that so? What sort\nof feelings do you suppose fill the space of time between the first\nseeing and the first loving, when the two are not almost simultaneous?\nJust interest and liking?\"\n\n\"It is no use looking questioningly at me,\" Evarne replied, shaking her\nhead gently. \"Besides, I thought men had always had so much past\nexperience in that direction that they knew just everything.\"\n\nGeoff smiled at her.\n\n\"Oh, you did, did you? I'm afraid that branch of my education has been\nshamefully neglected. And you--you cannot teach me?\"\n\n\"Can't I, then? I know every whit as much concerning love as did\nDiotima, who instructed Socrates in the art.\"\n\n\"And who taught you, pray?\"\n\n\"Don't be jealous. I never had to learn; it's a natural talent. Perhaps\nit was a gift from my fairy godmother.\"\n\n\"Then it is all theory?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\nFor half a minute Geoff did not speak. Painfully conscious that she had\nnow told him her first deliberate falsehood, Evarne glanced into his\nthoughtful eyes with sudden apprehension. Then she hastened to break in\nupon this silence, in which another such terrible question, incapable of\ntruthful answer, was perhaps being formulated.\n\n\"You must have thought you cared for somebody before you saw me, Geoff.\nDo tell me?\"\n\n\"Very well. Now this is the solemn truth. Not only have I never loved\nany other woman before you, but I've never even made the mistake of\nthinking a passing fancy was the real thing. I've never burned incense\nat the shrine of any false goddess. In my heart I've loved you all my\nlife--that is, the idea of you, Evarne. I've worshipped you and waited\nfor you, sweetheart, and now, thank God, I've found you.\"\n\nShe answered very gently and slowly, her heart glowing with triumph and\ndelight at his avowal.\n\n\"If it were possible, I should care for you even more after hearing you\nsay that. But how can I love you more than to the very uttermost of my\nnature, and I believe I have done that from the first.\"\n\nGeoffrey found this frank and unaffected confession more adorable than\nany coquettish hesitation could have proved.\n\n\"But even if I had not been able to win your heart, I should still have\nloved you always and ever, and held myself your knight, ready to obey\nyour slightest or your most difficult command, my queen,\" he avowed with\nboyish enthusiasm. \"I feel that it was preordained that I should love\nyou, and I should have readily fulfilled my fate, even if you had never\nbeen able to care for me in return.\"\n\nShe sighed and shook her head.\n\n\"Ah, Geoffrey, do you love me indeed? Almost I doubt it.\"\n\n\"You doubt it? Evarne!\"\n\n\"You can't imagine what I mean? Sit by my side and I'll explain.\"\n\nReclining delightfully in Geoff's arms, her slender arched feet curled\nup on the couch, she expounded her startling statement.\n\n\"When you say that it would not make any--well, not much--difference in\nyour feelings towards me if I did not care for you in return, I wonder\nif you are not indulging in a state of mind peculiar to poetic\ntemperaments such as yours, my dearest, and I feel jealous.\"\n\n\"Dear child--jealous of whom?\"\n\n\"Cannot you guess? Why, of Love itself. I believe you are so happy in\nhaving me to care for, simply because you delight in loving. You are a\nworshipper of love in the abstract; you fairly glory in that frame of\nmind people call 'being in love.' The possession of the emotion means\nmore to you than the possession of any particular woman. There are some\nterrible people like that. They would rather their mistress died than\nthat she should destroy the love she had awakened in their hearts.\"\n\n\"Now, fair Diotima, just please name one single individual who ever felt\nthat way.\"\n\n\"Easily! What about Dante, the patron saint of such sinners? Do you\nsuppose he could have had any ordinary personal affection for his\nprecious Beatrice? Why, he only saw her twice, or something of that\nsort, and she was respectably married to somebody else, yet she \nhis whole life, and he seems to have been quite contented. And he is\nnever without disciples--a few. Oh, I know you--people who are in love\nwith Love itself.\"\n\n\"Yes? Go on telling me about them.\"\n\nInterested though he was in her slightest word, Geoffrey, man-like, was\nnot giving all his mind to Evarne's ideas. He was enthralled by the\ncontemplation of her sinuous, supple form, her tenderly waving hair and\nsatin-smooth skin, and the live beams of her glancing eye; he was\nglorying in the dulcet music of her voice.\n\n\"Well,\" she went on, feigning discontent, while her very heart seemed\npulsating in notes of perfect happiness--\"well, you find some woman whom\nyou can idealise and adore, and if she be but passably gracious to you,\nyou proceed to make a world of happiness for yourselves merely from\nloving her, dreaming of her, writing poems to her or painting pictures\nthat you think she has inspired--though really it is nothing but your\nown capacity for loving that she has made active that is the true source\nof your inspiration. Even if you rarely see her it seems to make very\nlittle difference--you still dream, still find inspirations, still do\ngreat work under the divine influence of Aphrodite. You live in the\nenchanted Palace of Love, and once safely there, are horribly\nindependent of the woman who opened its magic portals to you. Oh, sorry\nfate that led me to love an artist! So long as I condescend to exist and\nremain tolerably young and beautiful, all is well. I cannot possibly\nfeel that your entire happiness depends upon my presence or my absence,\nmy smile or my frown. Now do you see my grievance?\"\n\n\"I can't believe you know it, but you actually seem to imply that you\ncare for me more sincerely, more humanly, than I do for you, which is\nobviously impossible.\"\n\n\"I don't see the 'obviousness.' I should rather like to.\"\n\n\"I'll soon tell you. You won't laugh at me?\"\n\n\"Laugh! Oh, my darling!\"\n\n\"Well, then, the fact that it is you, your own dear self, that I so\nglory in, and not any mere abstract mental condition, is proved by this.\nI confess I always hoped the time would come when I should be genuinely\nin love. That's what you are not to laugh at, by the way! I knew somehow\nthat I had all the capacity for intense devotion, and naturally enough,\nI suppose, longed to exercise it. So if practically any young and\nattractive woman would have served as the sort of figure-head you\ndescribe, should I have been forced to wait--unwillingly enough, I can\ntell you--until you, my only possible beloved, appeared upon the scene?\nOf course not.\"\n\n\"You had to wait for me--for me--for me!\" sang Evarne, keeping the time\nin her little song of triumph by clapping her hands.\n\n\"It is very wicked of you to be so pleased about it. Why did you not\ncome along earlier, my blessing? It is a perfect misery, nothing else,\nto be empty-hearted. It is terrible to feel a thousand emotions seeking\ndesperately for an outlet. Why did your star linger so long in crossing\nmine?\"\n\nBut no sympathy was to be extracted from Evarne.\n\n\"It has all been just as is best. You have been most fortunate,\" she\ndeclared. \"Love is not the be-all and end-all of any life, you know, and\nwhen you think of your chosen work--which is the real thing--I'm sure\nyou can't regret any emotional experiences, however distressing they may\nhave been in the learning. They are all needful training for the\nproduction of soul-stirring pictures; as necessary, in their way, as is\nthe enchantment of loving and being loved that is now going to help you\nstill further. Mental turmoil of every type bears its own special fruit\nthat may be garnered by an artist to his own advantage. Stagnation,\nignorance and lack of variety in emotions brings ultimate failure in\nimaginative work. Thus speaks Diotima the Second.\"\n\nFar-away, curious echoes seemed ringing in Evarne's brain. When and\nwhere and in what familiar voice had she heard such sentiments spoken\nlong, long ago?\n\n\"Well, it certainly is consoling to put all one's mental worries into\nthe same category as freehand drawing and perspective,\" declared Geoff;\nand being both ardently happy and therefore easily amused, they laughed\nmerrily.\n\nAfter a moment's pause he went on--\n\n\"But don't you think the secret tragedy of many a seemingly commonplace\nand prosaic person is the lack of someone to be earnestly and devotedly\nadored? Don't you think many and many a heart suffers from a craving to\nexercise strong powers of loving forever ungratified? I'm speaking of a\nspiritual demand--not of the universal desire to find a mate that is\njust part of Nature's artful little scheme for ensuring the due arrival\nof the next generation. Do you think that demand of the spirit proves a\nman merely a willing follower of Dante?\"\n\n\"Oh, no no!--I suppose not. But, despite your specious arguments, I\nstill maintain that you, individually, are one to rate love higher than\nany object. Obstinate, am I not?\"\n\n\"Absolutely wicked, you dearest. I love you, my Evarne--you yourself--in\nevery possible way under the sun, including the ordinary human love of\nany man, artist or not, for the woman he seeks for his wife. There is\nperhaps a tiny atom of truth in one of the charges you have hurled at\nme, but----\"\n\n\"I knew it, my dear commonplace lover. Confess, and I'll see if I can\nforgive you.\"\n\n\"I think, perhaps--dearest, I don't like even to speak of it--but\nperhaps even your--I mean, if the world lost you, my own beloved----\"\n\n\"If I died?\"\n\nHe flinched even at the words that expressed the possibility, but went\non--\n\n\"That it would cause a more--how can I express my meaning? Well, in one\nway, possibly, even that would cause a less ever-present gap in my\nmental life than would the destruction of my love for you.... It's no\nuse hitting me,\" he laughed; \"I can't help it, sweetest!\" Then he\nclasped her closely with sudden eager passion. \"But do not think that\nyour dreamer is at all content to worship only in spirit, Evarne.\"\n\nThen, impulsively, he poured forth a flood of words, ardent,\nimpassioned, throbbing with that fiery sex-love that dominates the\nentire world--selfish, unheeding, remorseless--words of that terrible\noverwhelming passion that will not be long denied.\n\n\"That's how I want to be loved,\" she whispered, but flung herself away\nfrom his grasp just in order to be drawn close once more.\n\nHe seized her convulsively, held her in a cruelly fast grip, covering\nher cheeks, her brow, her mouth with kisses, violent and tender in\nturns. At last, pressing his face against hers, he rested motionless.\nShe felt the influence of the contact spread itself slowly throughout\nher entire frame, subtle and concentrated as electricity, and under its\npower her breast heaved, and she breathed only in short troubled gasps.\nThe whole room, the whole world, seemed to be throbbing, to be\ntrembling--perhaps it was only the arms that enfolded her that\nquivered--she neither knew nor cared to know.\n\nA deep silence held sway. The only moment's speech was when Geoffrey\nmurmured a sudden question about their marriage, begging, imploring for\nan early date. It should be quite soon, Evarne promised. It should be\nwithin six weeks, five weeks, a month, less still, if he so desired.\n\nShe had hesitated perceptibly before she answered. This definite and\nverbal plighting of her troth was opposed--actively, violently--for a\nfew moments, by the resurrection of those scruples she fancied had faded\naway once and for all--false and misleading will-o'-the-wisps of\nchivalrous truth and honour, leading the unwise into bogs of wild\ndespair and utter misery. When at last she did speak it was in a voice\nfraught with tremulous emotion, low, yet inexpressibly thrilling--notes\nsofter than the cooing of wood-doves, and which reverberated upon the\nyoung artist's highly-strung nerves with subtle emphasis.\n\nMore than once Evarne had thought that his nature now was not unlike\nwhat her own had been originally, before three years of constant effort\nto please a jaded, middle-aged man, added to unbroken association with\ncoarse, depraved minds, had sullied her soul, blunted her finer\nsusceptibilities, ruined her taste for the more delicate viands of\nlove's feast. Once upon a time she had sought with all her strength to\nkeep the affection that was offered her free from all savour of passion;\nnow, when devotion, as poetical, refined and idealistic as imagination\ncould devise had been laid at her feet, she had felt starved, chilled,\nunsatisfied.\n\nBut as she looked into her dreamer's altered face and saw its new\nexpression, saw the grey eyes so strangely gleaming, the slight\noccasional twitching of his lips, the distinct though almost\nimperceptible veil of moisture that covered his brow, she felt for a\nmoment strangely degraded--curiously identical with the early Christian\nFathers' estimate of women. A moment's bitter regret of her own\npersonality cast its shadow. Geoff was too good for her. Ought he not to\nlove a young, innocent girl--one of those sweet maidens who are to be\nfound here and there even in this grimy world, with thoughts white as\nsnow-drifts, and surely invisible halos around their meek downcast\nheads--pure spirits that were scarcely conscious of possessing bodies,\nand would assuredly never miss them? Ought not one of these to have been\nGeoff's bright particular star?\n\n\"Are you certain you love me; that you're not deceiving yourself?\" she\nasked again and again, and each time the only response was a long kiss\nthat penetrated to her heart's core; a speaking, all-answering gaze; a\ncloser, almost frantic tightening of the arms in which she reclined.\n\nAnd her moods changed as a kaleidoscope. Suddenly she laughed aloud in\ntriumphant satisfaction at herself, all that she was, all that she could\nbe. Of course Geoff loved her, and he should love her yet more. Placid\nsnow-maidens--you must be content to shine in heaven; not yours is it to\nmake men thank God for life!\n\nNow to the man who loved her Evarne appeared the very acme of all\nperfection. And indeed, in that hour she verily was all that is most\nappealing--most adorable--most exquisite. Her beauty was transcendent,\nand her expression remained more noble, more respect-compelling than she\nknew. And yet, all the while, her soft brown eyes, whether swimming in\nhappy, purposeless tears or shining with inward fire, told, with more\nconvincing eloquence than lies within the power of speech, of the utter\nabandonment of the soul they mirrored to the domination of the most\nardent and enthralling affection. She was all tenderness, passion,\ncharm, fascination. Her powerful magnetism encircled her as an invisible\ncloud. Who, amid mortals, coming within the radius of its influence,\ncould have saved himself from worshipping this fair woman to the very\nuttermost limits of his capacity?\n\nThe stress of her own emotion was exhausting; a delicious languor, a\nplacid dreaminess, tinged with melancholy; crept upon her. She felt\nincapable of further movement or speech, and allowed her long-fringed\nlids to veil her eyes. When she lifted them again it was to behold her\nlover's gaze fixed upon her in a fresh access of passionate adoration\nthat could not be left unanswered. She smiled up at him, a gentle little\nsmile; it seemed serene and calm, but behind it, like unto a powerful\nnaked figure veiled in gauze, gleamed love that was resolute,\nindomitable, heroic.\n\nHer inarticulate little murmurs, her half-sighs, all her tiny actions\nhad been enchanting, enthralling; but her smile--always sweet and\nmoving--was now provocative of ecstasy. Dazed, unconscious of his own\npersonality, again Geoff knelt before her, his arms clasped around her\nwaist, his face pressed against her soft body. Oblivious to all of life\nsave love alone, he bathed his spirit in this inexhaustible fund of the\ngods' best gift.\n\nWhat said Evarne's most-admired philosopher?\n\n\"I say then of all in general, both men and women, that the whole of our\nrace would be happy if we worked out love perfectly, and if each were to\nmeet with his beloved.\"\n\nWas not Diotima, who taught Socrates, a wise woman indeed, capable of\nimparting the truest, the most divine of all wisdom?\n\nThus the winged hours sped past.\n\nA dainty little supper was ready, and finally they sat down side by side\nand played at eating. Over the little meal the conversation became\nreally quite practical and business-like.\n\nGeoffrey had said nothing of the prospect he had of succeeding sooner or\nlater to his childless cousin's earldom. That startling piece of\ninformation seemed to him to be best reserved for discussion on some\nother less idyllic occasion. But it was partly this that gave emphasis\nto his inquiry.\n\n\"You will not continue posing now, will you, dearie?\"\n\n\"I have not any choice,\" laughed Evarne. \"There are some people who make\nme. Let me see, there's the landlord and the tradesmen and----\"\n\n\"Then come here, won't you? Really, I not only want you--I need you. I'm\ngoing to start a big picture--any number of figures in it.\"\n\n\"What is the subject, and who am I to be?\"\n\n\"I want you for Andromache. I'm going to paint the captured Trojan\nwomen.\"\n\n\"I shall make a realistic captive, Geoff, being one in very sooth.\"\n\n\"And I verily believe I was inspired to paint such a subject by the\nconsciousness that I was free no longer, my captor. I shall make a great\nthing of this picture, Evarne; at least, I ought to. Everything will be\nin my favour. Poor old Jack! He is still lamenting his unprocurable\nmodel--his 'Belle Dame.'\"\n\n\"How different his work is from yours; poor old Jack!\"\n\n\"I am going to try hard to persuade him to take up portrait-painting\ndefinitely. He really is very clever, you know. He ought to do well. Or\nsculpture; he's quite strong at that. But he will insist on trying to be\nimaginative, and he doesn't shine there. Now, when is the earliest day\nyou can come?\"\n\n\"It so happens that I finish to-morrow with the man I'm sitting for at\npresent. That's Thursday, the twentieth, isn't it? Then I have nothing\nto do until Monday the twenty-fourth, when I ought--it's all\narranged--you see I didn't expect you home until September!\"\n\n\"A lot of engagements, have you?\"\n\n\"I've only a few spare days here and there for the next seven weeks.\"\n\n\"But we're going to be married long before that time. Look here, Evarne\nlove, give them all up! Don't sit for anyone else but me. Come, spoil me\na bit. Let me be selfish. My picture is all ready and waiting for the\nmodel.\"\n\n\"It's terribly unfair to the others, but----\"\n\n\"Never mind them. Seriously, I mean it.\"\n\n\"It's a shame, when they've been waiting, but there--it's delightful to\nbe unkind to other people, and treat them badly for your sake. It shall\nbe as you wish. It is wrong, though! Aren't you ashamed?\"\n\nA little later eleven o'clock struck. Evarne pinned on her hat.\n\n\"Oh, don't go yet! It's far too early,\" cried Geoffrey.\n\nBut Evarne only smiled.\n\n\"On the contrary, it is rather late. Say good-bye quickly,\" she\nresponded.\n\nThe timepiece ticked on placidly, neither faster nor slower than its\nusual steady wont.\n\n\"Goodness gracious, Geoff, you must send that silly old clock to be\nmended. It actually has jumped a whole quarter of an hour! It is no use\nits pretending we have been twenty minutes saying good-bye. Do call a\ntaxi quickly.\"\n\n\"And to-morrow I'm coming to supper with you. Oh dear me! twenty-four\nhours to wait!\"\n\n\"Only about twenty now; and remember, if our stars in their courses had\nnot chanced to touch, we might have both lived twenty-four years\nmore--and more still--and been lonely to the end. See what we have\nescaped.\"\n\nBy midnight Evarne was safely alone in her own little bedroom. She\nstudied her reflection in the mirror before removing her hat, and smiled\nwith pleasure to behold cheeks blooming as a blush rose; lips made up of\nhappy curves; and eyes shining for very joy as brightly as the most\nbrilliant stars in the summer heaven.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\n\n                         FRANK'S BRILLIANT IDEA\n\n\nOn Friday Evarne was free to give her time to Geoff, and the big Greek\npicture was duly commenced. Again she wore flowing white draperies, but\nof a more ornate and ample description than the very simple robe in\nwhich she had previously posed in this studio. Her head was encircled by\na barbaric fillet, studded with roughly-cut, albeit gleaming stones, and\nhigh up on her arms were wide bracelets of chased gold; for although a\ncaptive, fair Andromache was a princess. Yet those same arms bore\ndelicate fetters around the wrists, for Hector's widow was now a slave.\n\nOn her shoulder was to be borne a terra-cotta vase of classical design.\nIt was very beautiful, both in contour and workmanship, but it was far\nfrom small, and Geoff was troubled lest his dear model should grow\nweary.\n\n\"You must stop as soon as you even begin to feel tired; don't wait for\nthe ordinary rests. Will you promise?\" he demanded, and smiling her\nassent, she took up the required position.\n\nThe robe she wore was so fine in substance that where the material\nactually touched her body it appeared to become vaguely hued with the\nmost delicate, the most tender pink. On her arched feet were elaborate\nmany-strapped sandals; her classically beautiful head, inclined meekly\ndownwards, showed to perfection the gracious line at the back of her\nneck. She was indeed sufficient to arouse and inspire the most negligent\nof artists.\n\nBut it so chanced that Frank Pallister had just received an added\nimpetus to his industry from another quarter.\n\nA day or two before Geoff's unexpected return to England, Frank had paid\na solemn afternoon call on Mrs. Vandeleur. This stately matron was Mr.\nMeridith's widowed sister, who kept house for him and chaperoned pretty\nlittle Maudie. She viewed Frank and his suit with a favourable eye, yet\napproved her brother's decision with regard to the postponed engagement.\nThus, while a sense of duty prompted her to hover around with\nconsiderable persistence, it was often quite easy for the young people\nto make opportunities for whispered flirtations.\n\nThus, after duly listening to her complaints at being still in sultry\nLondon when August was practically at hand, from the necessity of Mr.\nMeridith's remaining in town until Parliament rose, Maudie and Frank\nfound opportunity to exchange secret groans over the unendingness of\nthree years.\n\n\"I wish to goodness I could shorten it!\" sighed the youth.\n\n\"Then why don't you?\" demanded the girl. \"You know what dad says about\nit. Now, Frankie, why don't you do something grand, superb,\nincomparable--something that would cause the whole world to admire and\nwonder, and make your name famous for ever and ever? I would, if I were\nyou, but you're a lazy boy, I know you are.\"\n\n\"It's easy to talk,\" was the rueful response. \"But you just listen to\nwhat I've got on hand. Some day soon, Jack Hardy is to be allowed to do\na marble bust of Lord Winborough. I told you, didn't I? If the great man\nwill consent to be so far victimised, Jack is going to start proceedings\nby taking a life-mask of him. Very well, then, I'm going to watch, and\nperhaps assist, and when I've learnt how to do it, I shall start and do\na bust of somebody or other who is well known. Then I have already got\nthree new pictures and two statuettes on hand. Some of the galleries are\nbound to take some of them when they're finished, I should suppose.\"\n\n\"Dear Frankie,\" was the answer given in all seriousness, \"I am so\nterribly afraid you're a genius!\"\n\n\"Afraid!\"\n\n\"Yes, for then you'll never get on in the world. It is only the\nsecond-rate people who reach the top of the ladder; the real born\ngeniuses stick on the bottom rung, just because their work is too\nsuperior to be understood and appreciated by the common mob. There! What\ndo you think of that? Dreadful, isn't it, poor boy?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you needn't upset yourself over my misfortunes in that\ndirection. Who told you all this piffle?\"\n\n\"Nobody exactly. I overheard two men talking at an 'at home.'\"\n\n\"Were they neglected geniuses?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I asked dad what they did, and he said he believed that\none composed poetry and that the other wrote tragedies.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like Frank to see Sir James's painting of you?\" interposed\nthe voice of Mrs. Vandeleur.\n\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Fancy my forgetting! It's finished at last. It's in the dining-room at\npresent. Come along. But don't expect much. It's not a bit nice; it's\nreally ugly.\"\n\nAnd indeed, on beholding the celebrated portrait-painter's production,\nFrank's loud exclamations of surprise and disdain were as profuse as the\nmost disappointed of sitters could desire.\n\n\"Isn't your dad annoyed?\" he demanded at length.\n\n\"Indeed, he's really vexed. He is paying so highly for it too. You\nremember the one of my mother that hangs in his study? That was done\nwhen she was seventeen, and he thought it would be so nice to have a\ncompanion one of his only kiddie at the same age. He wouldn't have\nminded the big price in the least if the picture had been satisfactory.\nThis has been altered ever so many times, and now Sir James has got\ntired, and swears it is exactly like me; but it isn't, is it?\"\n\n\"The old boy must be getting in his dotage. Now, I could paint you just\nbeautifully, I'm sure. You would be such a jolly subject. I say!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nPallister glanced round to make sure that Mrs. Vandeleur was safely out\nof earshot.\n\n\"Don't you think your dad would consent to our engagement without any\ndelay if I made a perfectly lovely picture of you? He would have to\nbelieve there was something in me then, wouldn't he?\"\n\n\"Oh, Frankie, what a perfectly fine idea. I dare say he would. Let's ask\nhim.\"\n\nBut the originator of the idea, with a frown of thought upon his brow,\nshook his head.\n\n\"To really have the proper effect it ought to be sprung upon him as a\ncomplete surprise--quite finished. 'Splendid! magnificent! superb!' he\nwill exclaim, when he sees it--at least, I hope that's what he will say!\nThen he will go on: 'Only tell me what artist has produced this\nmasterpiece.'\"\n\n\"And then you'll answer----?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I shan't speak a word--not a word! I shall just quietly and\nmodestly point to my name in the corner. Oh, isn't it just a ripping\nplan?\"\n\n\"Lovely! Perfectly delightful!\"\n\n\"But you'll have to come sometimes to Geoff Danvers's studio and give me\nsittings, won't you?\"\n\n\"Then auntie is to be in the secret?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be a secret for long if she knew. No, you must come alone.\nDo! It will be quite all right--really it will. Jack is always there,\nand we almost always have a woman model, so there would be a sort of a\nchaperone. You'll come? Remember what depends on it.\"\n\n\"It is awfully venturesome, but I'll do it,\" promised the girl after a\nmoment's hesitation.\n\nAt this point Mrs. Vandeleur approached, and the remaining details of\nthe conspiracy had to be hastily whispered at parting.\n\n\"You'll come as often as you can, duckie?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I shan't be able to let you know long beforehand.\"\n\n\"I'll get the canvas ready at once. Come to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Can't. I'll let you know when. What shall I wear?\"\n\n\"Any white frock.\"\n\n\"I'll remember. Good-bye.\"\n\nThis arrangement had been entered into over a week ago, and as yet no\nword had come from Maudie. Nevertheless Pallister was working away with\nrenewed ardour, living in a state of eager expectation. Of course, the\nlittle idea had to be confided to Geoff, since he had so unexpectedly\nreappeared upon the scene. Strangely enough, it did not appeal to him in\nthe light of an unquestionably brilliant notion preordained to success.\nHe was inclined to advise decidedly against it, but finding that his\nopinion, although formally asked, was in reality not wanted in the\nleast, he raised no actual objection to the carrying out of the plan.\n\n\"But, Geoff,\" persisted the somewhat crushed Pallister, \"surely it is an\nawfully fine idea, so enterprising and original. Don't you think so\nreally?\"\n\n\"I've told you I fancy it's quite as likely to vex Mr. Meridith as to\nplease him; but of course I may be mistaken. Who can tell what will melt\na stern father's stony heart? You know him much better than I do,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Well, it's awfully good of you, old chap, not to mind. I hope it won't\ninterfere with your work too much. You know, I rather feel I ought to\nclear out at once, now you've come back.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. Stop at least until Miss Meridith's portrait is done.\nYou couldn't ask her to go to any strange studio, you know. It's quite\ndifferent here, where her father knows the whole lot of us.\"\n\nSo much for Frank's enterprise.\n\nJack Hardy also was working with increased ardour, with renewed interest\nand hope.\n\nOn the afternoon of the very day of his return from Venice, Geoff had\ncalled at the Albany to make inquiries regarding Lord Winborough's\nwhereabouts. However far afield his cousin might happen to be, he almost\ninvariably returned to England in the late summer and paid frequent\nvisits to London.\n\nGeoff was anxious to persuade Lord Winborough now definitely to arrange\nto fulfil his promise of sitting to Jack Hardy. It had not taken Geoff\nlong to discover that his friend was unhappy and dispirited. The\nallegorical picture had been so far a miserable failure, and had left\nJack in exactly the frame of mind to follow the dictates of worldly\nwisdom. He knew in his heart that portraiture, whether in oils or\nmarble, was his _forte_, and the news that Lord Winborough was expected\nat his chambers in the course of a few days had served to brace him up\nanew. He would follow up the advantages in obtaining paying \"sitters\"\nthat would probably result from his exhibiting a successful bust of the\nearl, and the long-dreamed-of \"Belle Dame\" picture should really be the\nlast of its type, as far as he was concerned. Having definitely made up\nhis mind to this, he was rewarded by a renewal of enthusiasm and belief\nin the future.\n\nSaturday was devoted to work, but Geoff and Evarne spent the whole of\nSunday up the river. To both it was a time of unmitigated delight.\nSunshine, fair placid scenery, youth, health and love--what could have\nbeen added to render the hours more idyllic, golden, divine? If Evarne\nknew much sorrow, she had, as if in recompense, an intimate acquaintance\nwith a far deeper, a more intense happiness than ever falls within the\nlot of many. She and Geoff agreed that next Sunday should be passed in\nthe same manner. Quite definitely this was decided--\"unless it rained!\"\nThat was the only possible obstacle that presented itself. Ah well! the\nmere decision was pleasant, and served to soften the hour of parting.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\n\n                      THE SHADOW OF COMING EVENTS\n\n\nMonday morning dawned. Evarne looked more radiantly lovely than ever\nafter her day in the open air, and work was re-attacked with general\nardour. The only interruption to the proceedings was a ring at the door,\nwhich came as lunch-time was approaching. It proved to be a man with a\nletter for Geoff.\n\n\"This is rather interesting to us all!\" he exclaimed as he read it.\n\"Winborough arrived in London on Saturday. I left a note for him, you\nknow, Jack, and he says he will come at three o'clock on Wednesday to be\n'life-masked,' but he is coming in here this afternoon just to see us.\"\n\nJack flushed with sudden excitement and apprehension. Geoff laid down\nthe letter and looked at Evarne. These few days of their engagement left\nher still ignorant of his position and relationship towards Winborough.\nGeoff could hardly have given any reason for his reticence--there could,\nindeed, be no rational explanation forthcoming--it was just a\npurposeless fancy that had not mattered hitherto. But now she must know.\nShe always lunched with him in his sitting-room, while Jack and\nPallister sought their mid-day repast out of doors. He would tell her\nthen; and Lord Winborough himself must no longer be kept in ignorance of\nhis heir's forthcoming marriage. There seemed to be an ample dose of\n\"tellings\" before Geoffrey that day.\n\nBut Pallister all unconsciously relieved him of one.\n\n\"I'm really awfully excited,\" he declared. \"I've never seen his\nlordship, but Mr. Meridith knows him quite well. Maudie calls him a\n'dear.' And I'm awfully thrilled, too, at the prospect of taking a\nlife-mask. I shall be longing to try when once I've seen it done. Will\nyou let me practise on you, Miss Stornway?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. It's rather terrible, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. Only a bit unpleasant. Nothing to hurt.\"\n\n\"Have you done many, Mr. Hardy?\"\n\n\"Several. It's a wonderful help towards getting a likeness, especially\nif the sitter's time is precious. Still, it is uncommonly hateful to go\nthrough.\"\n\n\"Don't tell Lord Winborough that! How do you start?\"\n\n\"Well, you rub cold-cream or some such decoction well into the skin.\"\n\n\"For the sake of the victim's complexion, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Partly. Next you put a couple of quills into his nostrils.\"\n\n\"To breathe through?\" chipped in Pallister.\n\n\"Precisely; and very careful you have to be, I can tell you, considering\nthat it's the one and only way in which a supply of fresh air can be\nobtained, for the next step is to pour moist plaster all over the face.\"\n\n\"How clammy! Much of it?\"\n\n\"Not at first--only a thin layer; but after you've laid a piece of\nstring downways on either cheek, you add more plaster until it's about\nan inch thick. There it has to remain until it hardens. Then you draw up\nthe two strings, thereby cutting the mask into three parts, and take it\noff, a firm and absolute replica of the features.\"\n\n\"But it does sound rather dangerous,\" declared Evarne after a moment's\nthought.\n\n\"Not with ordinary care and attention. It's quite safe,\" Jack assured\nher; \"but it feels much worse than it is really. One's whole life\nundoubtedly depends on those two breathing-quills. I went through it\nonce myself, and I couldn't help thinking of what would happen if by any\naccident they got choked up. The operator always keeps a pair of\nscissors handy to snip off the end in case by any chance a splash of\nplaster happens to settle on it. Still, it needs a deal of nerve, I must\nconfess. You can't hear a sound except an indistinct sort of rumbling\nand the thud of your own heart like a sledge-hammer. I should think it's\na bit like being buried alive. I tried to lift an eyelid, but the\nplaster held it in an immovable grip, and of course your lips are so\nsealed that it is impossible to speak a single word. I assure you, it\ndid make me feel queer!\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" inquired Pallister meditatively, \"what would happen if you\njust _had_ to sneeze?\"\n\nBut Jack declined to venture an opinion.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't promise to be done,\" Evarne declared with some\ndegree of emphasis.\n\n\"Now, would you expect anybody to consent after that lurid description,\nJack?\" inquired Geoff, laughing. \"It's a good thing Winborough can't\nhear your vivid reminiscences, or he would suddenly recall some other\nimperative engagement for Wednesday afternoon.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he won't come anyhow,\" suggested Pallister, bent on teasing.\n\"You should just have heard a Socialist gentleman--one of your pet pals,\nI dare say, Jack--who was addressing an attentive and admiring audience\nin Hyde Park yesterday. 'These bloated haristiscrats, pampered from\ntheir cots upwards,' he declared, were, without exception, fickle and\nfalse and altogether unreliable, and 'ought to be wiped off the face of\nthe globe altogether!'\"\n\n\"But Lord Winborough hasn't been 'pampered from his cot upwards,'\"\nreturned Jack unperturbed. \"He only came into the title about five years\nago, so you see he is scarcely one of those whom 'my pet pal, the\nSocialist,' was referring to.\"\n\nPallister ceased grinning at his own wit.\n\n\"Oh, of course, I know. He will keep his promise right enough,\" he said\nseriously. Then, suddenly recollecting himself: \"I say, Geoff, I didn't\nmean to be personal. If your cousin goes and dies without children, we\ndon't expect you to alter, and be fickle and false and all the rest of\nit, just because you become Earl of Winborough, eh?\"\n\nEvarne's lips parted, and, turning her head, she gazed at Geoff with\neyes filled with utter amazement and incredulity. That young man threw\ndown his brushes.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said lightly, \"it's a quarter to one. I think we had\nbetter stop work and have lunch.\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" cried Pallister the lazy. \"Come along, Jackie, my boy;\nwe had better take plenty of time to strengthen ourselves for this\nafternoon. We have both got to make a good impression, you know.\"\n\nJack partly understood Geoff's evident anxiety to get them gone. He\npromptly pulled off his painting overall and put on his coat. Pallister,\nwith no such change of costume to effect, was already awaiting him, and\nin a very few minutes they were both out of the place.\n\nAlready Geoff had freed Evarne from her golden fetters. They fastened by\nmeans of snaps, and it needed the use of both hands to open them. The\nlong connecting chain was quite unbreakable, though charmingly light and\ndelicate in workmanship. He occupied the time while his friends were\ndressing in subjecting it to a series of vigorous little tugs, as if to\ntest its strength; but directly the studio door had closed, he cast it\naside and turned to Evarne.\n\n\"Surely I didn't understand rightly?\" she queried, in tones of\nill-suppressed anxiety. \"I thought Mr. Pallister seemed to say that Lord\nWinborough was not only your cousin, but that you were his heir?\"\n\nGeoff acknowledged this to be verily the truth.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know why I didn't mention it long ago,\" he continued\napologetically. \"It's very silly of me to appear to have made any sort\nof a mystery about it, for naturally it's no secret. It can't be exactly\ntermed a misfortune in itself, can it, while of course it does not make\nthe slightest little bit of difference in our feelings for one another?\"\n\n\"I am not so sure,\" rejoined Evarne sadly.\n\nWith slow steps she walked across the room and sat down by the open\nwindow, gazing out into vacancy with troubled eyes. She felt no\npleasurable excitement, no eager interest, in this marvellous piece of\nnews. On the contrary, the fact that her lover held a position of so\nmuch greater importance in the estimation of the world than she had for\none moment suspected, appeared to her simply and solely as an\nunqualified misfortune. Viewed in the light of this new discovery, his\nmarriage with a woman who was, after all, only an artist's model, and,\nmoreover, one weighed down by a secret that a very few inquiries on the\npart of the curious might reveal, became a matter of entirely different\nimport. Such ominous forebodings, such fresh doubts and apprehensions\ncrowded upon her, that tears burned under her eyelids, while an\nexpression of utter misery settled upon her features.\n\nGeoffrey sped over to her side.\n\n\"My own dearest darling, please, please don't look so worried about it.\nI'm so sorry I didn't tell you at once, but left you to find out so\nsuddenly. I was an idiot. If you look like that, I shall never forgive\nmyself. Why does it make you unhappy? I should have thought you'd be\nrather pleased, if anything. What a sigh! After all, it's not so\nwonderfully important. It will not make the least bit of difference to\nus for years and years to come--perhaps never--who can tell?\"\n\nEvarne did not answer. The longer she reflected the more overwhelming\nappeared this unforeseen complication. Of course, as soon as her\nengagement became common knowledge, all sorts of people would want to\nlearn all about her; the events of her whole past life would probably be\ndelved into--and then--what? She wished Geoffrey would leave her alone\nfor a time. She wanted to think.\n\nBut the more anxious and depressed she appeared, the more concerned and\nself-reproachful he grew.\n\n\"I'm not vexed with you personally, dear,\" she was at length compelled\nto explain. \"You mustn't think that for a moment. Only--only----\"\n\n\"Only what?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of a part of Mrs. Browning's translation of 'Prometheus\nBound.' Do you remember it?\n\n    \"Oh, wise was he, oh, wise was he,\n    Who first within his spirit knew,\n    And with his tongue proclaimed it true,\n    That love comes best that comes unto\n    The equal of degree!\n    And that the poor and that the low\n    Should seek no love from those above....\"\n\nShe broke off suddenly.\n\n\"Oh, Geoffrey, that is true! I know it is, and it does seem so suited to\nus now.\"\n\n\"I noticed you discreetly ceased before reaching the last lines, which\nwould make the application I suppose you intend far from complimentary\nto me, Mistress Evarne. My soul is neither 'proud' nor 'fluttered by\nrows of ancestral lights,' or anything of that sort. Nothing 'flutters'\nit except your sweet self, so that verse does not suit at all. How dare\nyou shake your head? Don't you believe me?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! I do, of course. But there is your cousin to consider. I\nshall never gain his goodwill. He will never give his consent.\"\n\n\"Our marriage will be legal without that, my own dearest. But really,\"\nand Geoff came out boldly with a thundering big lie, \"really I don't\nanticipate his raising any serious objection. You see, it would be too\nabsurd, considering that it's the merest chance that he has got any\ntitle at all. When the old earl and his brother, and both his sons and\nhis little grandson all died within three years, it was necessary to go\nback over a century--if you ever heard of such a thing--before they came\nto the point at which the line from which we are descended branched off.\nWhy, for my part, I scarcely realised we were related to the family at\nall. We didn't even know the old earl personally. It would be too absurd\nof us to put on airs and graces as if we were superior sort of creatures\nborn to wear strawberry-leaves. It's just simply the merest chance. Now,\nafter that long explanation don't let's talk about it any more, since it\nworries you.\"\n\n\"I must say one thing. We have never spoken at all yet about money or\nposition, or anything of that sort, have we? Still, I have known all\nalong, and you also must have known full well, that in choosing me you\nwere marrying in every respect far below yourself and what your people\nwould deem----\"\n\n\"Oh!\" broke in Geoff, \"please, please don't talk in that manner. It\nisn't generous of you, Evarne. It isn't like you.\"\n\n\"I must finish, though. You are proposing to marry far below what your\nrelations would consider seemly in any case, and most undeniably you\nhave not made a fitting choice when one remembers what the future\nprobably holds for you. You don't see things quite as other people do,\nyou know; but I am more worldly-minded and practical. I think--I do\nreally--that this engagement between us is scarcely suitable, and that\nit ought not to exist.\"\n\nGeoff placed his hands heavily on her shoulders with a somewhat frantic\ngrip, and looked at her in serious alarm for a moment. Then he spoke\nwith forced carelessness.\n\n\"So you really think to persuade me of your claim to be considered\n'worldly-minded' by trying now to get me to give you up, do you--you\ndarling? Listen to me. I shall marry you or nobody! If you won't have\nme, I shall go down to my grave a morose, disagreeable old bachelor. I\nshall always be doing my level best to make all around me utterly\nmiserable, and although everyone will fear and hate me, a few discerning\nfolk will explain, 'Oh, don't you know? That poor old man was crossed in\nlove in the days of his youth, and has never got over it!' Would you\nlike to have that on your conscience, Evarne mine? Now, come in to\nlunch, and we won't speak another word of cousins or earls or prospects\nor anything of the sort. We will just talk about ourselves. We are by\nfar the most interesting topic in the world, aren't we, darling?\"\n\nHe caught her hand and commenced to draw her across the room. He looked\nso young, so happy, so full of life, that Evarne forcibly thrust all her\nown miseries back into the depth of her heart. She could not endure to\nsee the glad look fade from his eyes even for a minute.\n\n\"Very well, Geoff,\" she said in all meekness. \"As long as you are sure\nthat you really want me, I will never leave you of my own accord.\"\n\n\"That's a promise?\"\n\n\"Very well, it shall be. But remember this, if you do come to believe\nthat perhaps you would do wisely to listen to what I feel convinced your\ncousin's advice will be, you must not hesitate or think of me at all. I\nonly exist now to please you, and I'm not afraid of spoiling you by\ntelling you so, dear. My first and only wish is that everything shall be\nwell with your life. Remember.\"\n\nHe bent his head and kissed the hand he held, but declined to even\ndiscuss this subject with any seriousness.\n\n\"Come,\" he said lightly. \"I'm starving hungry! More than anything else\nin the world at the present moment I want you to give me my lunch.\"\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\n\n                         SEKHET WHETS HER TEETH\n\n\nNo one felt able thoroughly to settle themselves steadily to work that\nafternoon, for Lord Winborough had not timed his visit, and might be\nexpected at any moment.\n\nThey laughed and chatted for some time, but gradually painting was\nbeginning to engross somewhat of its usual meed of attention, when the\nelectric bell rang out.\n\n\"That will be Winborough,\" declared Geoff as he left the room\nimmediately to admit his visitor.\n\nThe studio door swung to, so that only a confused murmur of voices came\nfrom the hall. In a minute it was opened again, and Geoff was heard\nsaying--\n\n\"Oh yes, we're all much the same as usual. You remember Jack Hardy, and\nthis is Frank Pallister.\"\n\nEvarne was standing with her back towards the door, and as the two young\nmen had at once crossed over in that direction, they had passed out of\nthe range of her vision; for, despite these interruptions, with the\ninstincts of a thoroughly good model she had not stirred unbidden from\nher pose.\n\nShe heard Jack make a brief speech in his most polite style, though\nobviously with considerable nervousness.\n\n\"I want to thank you, Lord Winborough, for so kindly consenting to spare\nsome of your time to sit for me. I know how busy you are, and am more\nthan grateful.\"\n\nThe answer came in smooth, even tones.\n\n\"Indeed, Mr. Hardy, it is a pleasure to be able to assist in any degree\nso talented and--\"\n\nAt the sound of this voice an icy hand seemed to lay itself upon\nEvarne's heart, chilling her blood. With parted lips and eyes staring\nwith terror she turned round. There, in the centre of the little group,\nstood--Morris Kenyon!\n\nWell may the rapidity of thought be employed as a synonym for the\nuttermost conception of speed. Simultaneously with the tremendous mental\nshock of beholding this man again under such horrible, such undreamed-of\ncircumstances--above the resultant seeming cessation of all the wheels\nof life within her body, the sudden uncontrollable shivering that shook\nher from head to foot--she became conscious that her brain was\nfrantically urging her to instantly do something by which to account for\nthis physical agitation--something to explain this uncontrollable\ndisplay of emotion. It prompted the method. She followed it without a\nsecond's hesitation. Before any of the men had turned their gaze upon\nher, she had deliberately let go of the vase she carried. It fell\nheavily, and was smashed into a dozen pieces.\n\nDown on her knees she sank, bending her head low, as, with trembling\nhands, she gathered together the nearest fragments. Her actions were\nquite instinctive; her whole mind was bent on the recovery of her\nself-control. And she succeeded. When, after a minute's respite, she did\ndare lift her face, it was marked by no traces of greater concern than\ncould easily be accounted for as the result of this embarrassing\naccident.\n\nIf Morris Kenyon, seeing her again with equal unexpectedness, had been\nguilty of any dramatic start or exclamation, it had passed quite\nunnoticed. All attention was turned upon Evarne, and Geoff was already\nby her side.\n\n\"My dear, what is the matter?\"\n\nShe would not meet his eyes; her own might be too full of emotion. She\nsought to speak, but no words came.\n\nGeoff grew alarmed.\n\n\"Are you feeling ill? Can I do anything? Never mind those silly broken\npieces. Tell me!\"\n\nShe made a tremendous effort. She could--she should--answer him\nrationally and calmly.\n\n\"I'm frightened, Geoff,\" she whispered quickly and very softly--\"after\nwhat I learnt this morning. You understand? His voice sounded so hard,\nand he looks so stern. I was frightened.\"\n\nHe put his hand over hers and pressed it sympathetically, but no more\ncould be said in confidence. The three other men had approached.\n\n\"What's happened, Miss Stornway?\" inquired Jack.\n\nGeoff explained.\n\n\"She's tired, that's all. She ought to have rested long ago.\"\n\nEvarne spoke for herself.\n\n\"I'm so dreadfully grieved to have broken this beautiful vase. I can't\nthink how I came to drop it. Oh, I am so sorry.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter the least bit,\" Geoff declared emphatically.\n\nEvarne was now seated on the edge of the throne, and for a minute the\nfour men stood in a semicircle, silently surveying her. She could have\nwrung her hands in agony under this scrutiny.\n\n\"Please don't bother about me any longer,\" she cried, and there were\ntraces of rising excitement in her voice. \"I am so sorry to have made\nsuch a stupid disturbance. Please, please leave me alone now. There's\nnothing the matter with me.\"\n\nGeoff took her at her word.\n\n\"Come over here and look at the beginning of my new picture,\nWinborough,\" he suggested, after a final keen and anxious glance at\nEvarne.\n\nWhile the scarcely-started canvas was being explained, and attention was\nthus entirely distracted from herself, Evarne brought all the force of\nher will to bear on gaining complete self-mastery. And for this she had\nneed to call upon that emergency fund of strength, endurance and\nresolution that a woman's fine nervous system almost invariably produces\nwhen great necessity demands. Every moment the horror that assailed her\nappeared to grow more crushing, more unendurable, yet she sat there\nsilent and motionless, with an unruffled brow and an expression of\nperfect calm upon her beautiful features.\n\nShe could not keep her fascinated gaze from the spectacle of the two\ncousins going the round of the room together, Geoff chatting gaily as he\ndisplayed the various little oddments and curiosities that he had\nbrought from Italy. Finally he produced a portfolio of water-colour\nsketches and handed them to his cousin one by one, describing,\nexplaining, pointing out various parts that were to be especially\nnoticed. Morris nodded, questioned, admired, held them at arm's-length\nto be better judged, all apparently without another thought in his mind\nbeyond Art and Venice.\n\nAs the two men stood thus side by side, Evarne could most distinctly see\ntraces of the relationship between them--more in the demeanour, the\ngeneral build and outline, than in feature--but kinship, clear and\nunmistakable. There was exactly the same carriage of the head, much the\nsame walk, while their hands--slender, long-fingered and especially\nwell-tended--were practically identical.\n\nMorris had changed very little in the seven years that had been lived\nthrough since the stormy scene that had marked that final parting on\nthat spring morning in Paris. His dark hair was thinner, perchance, and\nturning grey upon the temples; there were a few more of Time's scratches\nupon his brow. But although he must be now somewhere about fifty-five,\nhis figure--thanks probably to his devotion to fencing--was still as\nslender, as trim and upright as that of any of the younger men in the\nroom.\n\nEvarne had opportunity of studying his appearance at leisure, for not\nonce did he glance in her direction. She knew this must be intentional,\nand was so far grateful, though such a mild emotion could find scant\nplace in her mind just then. It was almost unendurable to see those two\nmen standing side by side thus. Not only was the instinct of\nself-preservation on the alert, but every refined impulse in her nature\nwas outraged by the spectacle. Unconsciously she caught hold of the\nslightly overlapping edge of the floor of the throne, and dragged at it\nwith such unsparing force that the muscles of her arms stood up terse\nand hard.\n\nThe sketches all surveyed, the conversation turned on Jack, his work and\nthe bust that was to be undertaken.\n\n\"I've just finished a life-size statue of a child,\" Jack said.\n\"It's only in clay at present, but I am going to work it out in\nmarble--perhaps as a memorial-stone. You think it is good, don't you,\nGeoff?\" and he turned anxiously towards his friend for confirmation.\n\n\"Indeed it is splendid,\" was the ready answer \"You should see it,\nWinborough. It is in the plaster-room yonder. It is a dreadful weight to\nlift. Will you go in there and look at it?\"\n\nWinborough cordially assented, and escorted by Jack and Pallister he\nleft the studio.\n\nGeoff did not accompany the trio. He was anxious about Evarne, and,\nsitting down beside her, he slipped his arm around her waist as he\ndeclared in a tone of raillery--\n\n\"Well, sweetheart, you have surprised me! I had no idea you were such a\nlittle coward. I thought you were as brave as anything.\"\n\nShe hastened to account for this sudden weakness by numerous excuses. It\nseemed to her that it must necessarily have aroused some suspicion,\nalthough Geoff's manner showed not the slightest trace of any such\nfeeling.\n\n\"I don't like you to think me cowardly,\" she said, \"so please remember\nall I have had lately to upset me. First of all, I have not really been\nfeeling fit to pose lately. I'm weary! The engagement I finished on\nThursday was a terribly trying one. I stood for that wretched artist for\nthe figure for nearly six weeks without missing a single day except\nSundays. He wanted to get his picture done before he went away for his\nholidays, and he succeeded, but it made me quite ill.\"\n\nGeoff was properly indignant.\n\n\"It was enough to kill you; you should not consent to do such things.\nYou must not play with your health like that. You ought never to have\nsat at all for such a selfish brute.\"\n\nEvarne shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"You see, you don't know what it is to have to earn your own living,\"\nshe declared with a little smile. \"I certainly did intend resting for\nthe remainder of the week, but you were so anxious to start your\npicture, dear, that I went right on without even a day's interval.\"\n\nNow Geoff was indeed repentant.\n\n\"Oh, my darling, I didn't understand! I didn't know! It's all my fault.\nHow horribly thoughtless I am! Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\n\"I didn't think it would matter. I am very strong, you know, as a rule.\nBut what I learnt this morning so suddenly worried me seriously; and\nthen--I told you--I got so frightened when your cousin was really here,\nthat my silly hands trembled, and I broke that vase that I know you\nvalue. So altogether, if I was a bit pale and not quite myself, it\nwasn't without sufficient cause, was it?\"\n\nEven as she spoke she found herself wondering why she took this trouble\nto blind Geoffrey's eyes. If he did not immediately learn the true\nreason of her alarm at the sight of his cousin, he would know\nto-morrow--or the day after--or the day after that! It could be only a\nquestion of a more or less brief time. Why not give up the struggle at\nonce? Her heart ached as she listened to his expressions of\nself-reproach, knowing as she did that he had been unfailingly kind and\nconsiderate towards her from the hour of their first meeting.\n\n\"Evarne, dearest, do forgive me. You have made me feel terribly\nremorseful. One thing after another for you to endure, and all my fault!\nIf that is the best care I can take of you, I don't deserve to have you,\nthat's certain. Dear, say you forgive me this time. I will try and be\nmore thoughtful.\"\n\nHe drew her closer to his side, and right gladly would she have rested\nthere and endeavoured to forget the world, its deceptions and its\ndifficulties. But this was most decidedly not the time for such\nindulgence, and she was in the very act of withdrawing herself from his\nencircling arm, when exactly that which she was seeking to avoid came to\npass. Jack must needs choose this psychological moment to throw open the\ndoor and conduct Winborough back into the studio.\n\nIt was an awkward moment for everyone. Geoff rose to his feet, but did\nnot loosen his arm from around Evarne. It merely slipped upwards from\nher waist to her shoulders.\n\nJack looked absolutely aghast. Pallister gave vent to a silly\ninopportune little snigger, while Winborough demanded somewhat\nsarcastically--\n\n\"Do you spend much of your time studying art by such methods, Geoffrey,\nmy boy?\"\n\n\"Let me explain,\" said the young man without a moment's hesitation. \"It\nmay come as a complete surprise to you, Winborough; but Jack, and even\nPallister, who have been here with us in the studio, must be fully\nprepared to hear of my good fortune. I mean that I have asked Miss\nStornway to become my wife, and she has consented.\"\n\nThat even under these difficult circumstances Geoffrey would make this\nstartling announcement publicly, on the spot, without either warning or\npreparation, was as unlooked-for by Evarne as it could have been by any\nof the others. But the emergency did not find her wanting. With this new\ndemand came fresh strength. Instantly rising to her feet, she drew\nherself up to her full height, lifted her head proudly, and without the\nslightest trace of fear or faltering, advanced a couple of steps\nforward. Then, by sheer force of will she compelled Morris Kenyon to\nmeet her eye, and resolutely concentrated the whole of her mental\nstrength to its uttermost limits in sending forth a wordless message--a\ncommand--that this man should not speak to betray her.\n\nAnd silence prevailed in the room!\n\nEvarne remained motionless, her soft robes falling around her in\ngracious dignified folds, her beautiful head haughtily upraised. She\nmade herself, by mere force of character and dauntless determination,\nabsolute mistress of the situation for the time being.\n\nBut the fetters were still around her wrists!\n\nThe silence was finally broken by Geoffrey. Turning from the cousin with\nwhom he had but little in common, he looked across at his chosen friend,\nand asked somewhat coldly--\n\n\"Well, Jack, have you nothing to say?\"\n\nThus adjured, that young man pulled himself together.\n\n\"My dear Geoff, I--I really--I do congratulate you--both of you. I'm\nsure you'll be happy.\"\n\n\"You've completely floored me,\" cried Pallister gaily, recovering his\nbreath. \"I'm so surprised, you can come and knock me down with a feather\nif you want to. I'm sure I congratulate you heartily. Three cheers for\nMr. and Mrs. Danvers! Hurrah! Can I be best man?\"\n\nBut Evarne scarcely heard anything of this. She and Morris still stood\nseparated by the length of half the room, gazing sternly into one\nanother's eyes, each reading and sending forth defiance, antagonism,\nmutual hatred.\n\nYet when Winborough at length spoke it was in tones that were quite\nlight and casual.\n\n\"If marriage wasn't such a confounded knot to untie, there would not be\nthe same need for careful consideration beforehand that undoubtedly\nthere is now--more's the pity! When you do marry, Geoff, I wish you\nevery happiness--that you know.\"\n\nEvarne returned to the throne and sat down again. Having averted the\ndanger of Morris speaking out on impulse at first hearing Geoff's\nannouncement, she felt herself safe for the minute. He would indeed be\nstrangely altered if he now suddenly burst forth into accusations,\nmaking a scene in the presence of Jack and Pallister, and running the\nrisk of ensuring public talk and scandal. Besides, she still retained\nsufficient faith in his honour to believe that he would not deliberately\ngive away her secret to men whom it did not concern.\n\nBut before long her apprehensions were again up in arms.\n\n\"You are inhospitable here,\" announced his lordship. \"Do artistic\naspirations do away with parched throats, even on sultry July\nafternoons? If so, that's rather an important point for temperance\nadvocates. For my part, fancying I remember where you keep your whisky\nand syphons, Geoff, I'm going to see if I can look after myself, eh?\"\n\nWith the utmost nonchalance he strolled out of the studio. As Winborough\nhad anticipated, Geoffrey promptly followed him.\n\nAs soon as they were alone in the sitting-room, Winborough rounded on\nthe young man sharply.\n\n\"Look here, what folly is this? Is it possible you are really thinking\nof marrying that girl?\"\n\n\"I told you so plainly enough, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Preposterous! Do you suppose you can be allowed to take up seriously\nwith any stray creature who happens to please your fancy? The idea is\nabsurd--utterly absurd!\"\n\nGeoff's eyes flashed, but he kept his temper. He had fully anticipated\nthat Winborough would at first oppose this marriage. But of course all\nobjections were founded on mere prejudice and ignorance, so he answered\nquietly in the hope of explaining and thus conciliating his cousin. He\ntried to express the admiration, the respect and the affection he felt\nfor Evarne, in a manner totally devoid of any exaggeration or seeming\nblindness, but with unmistakable clearness and certainty.\n\n\"You are prejudiced against Evarne because of her profession,\nWinborough; but when you have known her for a little while you will be\nforced to acknowledge that, despite it, she is in every respect as near\nperfection as any human being can possibly be. In culture and\nrefinement, in mind and manner, she is the equal of my own mother. She\nis absolutely honourable and straightforward and high-principled, and I\nlove her. Now, I ask you, what more can one want? If she is a bit below\nme socially, that is the one and only drawback--such as it is--that\nanyone can possibly adduce; and after all, it is her personality and my\nfeelings that are the matters of real consequence. Isn't that so?\"\n\n\"Not entirely. Her character and her past record are of the utmost\nimportance. Now, what do you know of her? Not much, I'll be bound. No,\nmy boy, when you do finally decide to marry, you must choose some nice\ngirl in your own station of life. One who has been properly brought up,\nand about whom there can be no question, which is more than can be said\nfor Miss Stornway.\"\n\n\"You presume most abominably upon our relationship,\" Geoff was\ncommencing angrily, but both his sentence and the remainder of the\nconversation were doomed to remain unfinished. Hurried footsteps were\nheard in the hall, and Jack charged into the room, crying--\n\n\"I say, get some brandy or something quickly! Miss Stornway has\nfainted.\"\n\nWith a feeling akin to despair had Evarne watched the two men leave the\nstudio. It had been so obviously a mere contrivance on Morris's part to\nspeak to his cousin alone. Now the blow was to fall, and what possible\nmeans had she of preventing it? A sudden consciousness of her own\nweakness, her utter impotence, swept across her, bringing something not\nunlike resignation in its train. She would change her costume and go\naway--everything was over! She stood up, but with the more commanding\nattitude the fighting spirit rallied again. She would not yield yet. She\nwould strive till the very last.\n\nThe imperative need of the immediate moment was to end that\n_t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ now proceeding. Morris and Geoff had been alone scarcely a\ncouple of minutes. No harm was perhaps done yet, but every second might\nbe of consequence. How was it to be stopped--how--how? She cast about in\nher mind for an inspiration. Ah! was there any wisdom in belonging to\nthat sex that men designate \"the weaker,\" and yet never taking advantage\nof it in emergencies such as this? Without a second thought she gave a\nlow cry, raised her hand to her head, let herself drop heavily upon the\nfloor, and there lay just as she had fallen--motionless, helpless, with\nclosed eyes and scarce fluttering breath.\n\nThe anticipated result ensued. Half a minute later Geoff was on his\nknees hanging over her in an agony of dismay, while Winborough might\nhave been absolutely non-existent for all the attention he was able to\ncommand.\n\nEvery device known to man for the conquering of a fainting attack did\nEvarne allow to be vainly essayed before finally lifting her languid\neyelids. A look of relief passed over three anxious countenances.\nWinborough stood leaning against the door, surveying the scene. His\nfeatures bore an expression that might have puzzled the uninitiated, but\nEvarne understood. Meeting her eye, he smiled at her. Their mutual\nglance was scarcely more than instantaneous, but it was all-sufficient.\nShe knew right well that not for a moment had he been deceived by her\npretended swoon. Geoff's gaze, fixed intently on the face so dear to\nhim, saw a shadow of distress pass over it as a fleeting cloud. He\nlooked rapidly at Winborough over his shoulder, but no explanation was\nforthcoming from that quarter, and he turned all his attention again to\nhis \"Sweet Lady.\"\n\nShe was supported to the open window, ensconced in an arm-chair;\ncushions were arranged behind her head; a footstool was brought for her\nfeet. More than once, as Winborough watched all this care and attention,\nthe same mocking smile hovered around his lips.\n\n\"Don't leave me,\" murmured the invalid, laying her hand upon Geoff's\narm.\n\nBut even as she spoke she stole a glance at the man standing by the\ndoor. He it was with whom an undisturbed interview was essential. Each\nmust learn the other's mind--it was imperative.\n\n\"I have an idea that if I could say a few words to your cousin while I'm\nso ill, it might soften his heart towards me,\" she whispered, after a\nbrief period of perplexed thought. \"Do arrange for me to have a minute\nor two alone with him, to see if I cannot persuade him to think more\nkindly of me.\"\n\n\"I will call him over if you like.\"\n\n\"But I can't talk about you while you're listening. That would be\nembarrassing for me, wouldn't it?\"\n\nBut Geoff was reluctant.\n\n\"Oh, he is in a nasty temper. He would very likely say something to\nwound your feelings, and you have borne more than enough lately. Don't\nbother about him.\"\n\n\"I can't endure to make trouble between you. Do let me try. He doesn't\nlook very stern now,\" she declared.\n\nWinborough was engaged in conversation with Jack and Pallister, and was\nobviously making himself as pleasant as he so well knew how to do when\nhe chose. Nevertheless, Geoff frowned slightly and shook his head.\n\nBut with a very little more perseverance, Evarne, as usual, got her own\nway. A few minutes later she found her enemy standing by the side of her\nchair in an otherwise empty room, and heard herself directly addressed\nby that voice which, above all others, she had hoped and believed would\nnever fall upon her ears again.\n\n\"Will you accept my compliments upon your really admirable presence of\nmind.\"\n\nShe sat erect with amazing alertness.\n\n\"Morris! So you are his cousin?\" she cried, for the first time allowing\nthe full horror she felt to appear in both tone and expression.\n\n\"Most unfortunate, isn't it?\" he agreed. \"If it had been any other man\nwhatsoever I wouldn't have spoiled your little game. As it is, of\ncourse--well, I'm sure you will understand.\"\n\n\"Do you really suppose I'm going to give him up quietly, simply to\nplease you?\" she demanded--then added hastily, \"But we can't talk about\nit here.\"\n\nMorris raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Is there anything to discuss? Oh, I understand. Pardon my dullness.\nWe'll make that all right. I'm not ungenerous. Where are you living?\nWhere can I come and see you?\"\n\nSo he was actually taking her words to imply that she wanted money. She\nopened her lips, ready with an indignant denial, but stopped short. Let\nhim labour under this delusion for the time being. It was a decided\nadvantage.\n\nShe gave him her address.\n\n\"I am posing here all day,\" she explained. \"You can come in the evening\nat half-past seven.\"\n\n\"I am engaged to-night. Expect me to-morrow. I'll drop in after I've\ndined. Somewhere between eight and nine. I say, Evarne.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You won't throw the furniture at me, will you?\"\n\nShe found no answer for this taunt. Leaning back in the chair, she\nturned her head wearily away, while a couple of big tears gathered in\nher eyes. He was very brutal--very heartless. What was she to do, or say\nto him?\n\nIn another minute the door had swung to behind him, and Geoff was\nbending over her.\n\nShe looked up mournfully, while the big tears overflowed and trickled\nunrestrainedly down her cheeks.\n\n\"It was quite useless,\" she murmured brokenly. \"He is absolutely\ndetermined to prevent our marriage. Oh, Geoff, my dearest, I am so\nunhappy. What am I to do? I love you so much.\"\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\n\n                          THE STROKE OF SEKHET\n\n\nThe resonant strokes of great clocks boomed forth the third hour after\nmidnight; the sounds faded away languidly upon the heavy air, and\nsilence reigned once more over the sleeping city. Evarne wandering\ndownstairs, leaned out of the landing-window counting the tones,\nlistened until they had died into nothingness, then, with a shuddering\nsigh, continued her way to the sitting-room.\n\nHour after hour throughout this seemingly endless night had she wandered\nover her little house, pacing to and fro distractedly in every room in\nturn. Morris Kenyon had come again into her life, and to stop her\nmarriage would, if necessary, ruthlessly betray her secret to Geoff. It\nwas beyond any possibility of doubt. That brief interview with him had\nclearly shown his intention. What power had she to prevent it? He would\ntell all--and then--what then? Even in imagination the results were\nwell-nigh insupportable. And this approaching blow would not--could\nnot--fall on herself alone; and in this reflection there lay a sting\npotent as that of the torturing gadfly that drove Io of old wandering\nover land and water seeking peace in vain.\n\nWhy, why had she ever risked this calamity? She ought to have told Geoff\nthe whole truth about herself directly she saw he was growing really to\ncare for her. But now, as an additional offence, she had been guilty of\nsuch brazen lies; had deceived him both by words and by silences so\ncontinually and deliberately. Her whole conduct towards him must now\nappear shameful, utterly dishonourable. It was almost impossible to hope\nthat his affection would endure in the face of such dire discoveries, it\nwas quite out of the question to expect him afterwards implicitly to\nbelieve even her strongest assertions. Strive as she might to explain\nher motives, to excuse trickery that she could not deny, however\nearnestly she should plead, mourn, regret, she could never do away with\nthese damning, irrefutable facts. What would Geoff think and say and do?\nSurely his revulsion of feeling would be terrible and complete?\n\nAnd if, despite all, he could not cease to care for her--why, so much\nthe worse for him! He who so desired to reverence where he loved could\nfeel but contempt, or at least mere forgiving, generous pity. In place\nof trust and glad confidence--doubt, surmise, unrest. Better far for her\n\"dreamer\" if all memory of her could fade entirely from his thoughts. To\nlove with the heart and despise with the intellect--it could be done.\nBut it was cruel suffering; it bordered on the unendurable! She herself\nknew only too well the mental torture that such complex emotions imply.\nWas she to be the means of forcing Geoff to acquire this bitter\nknowledge?\n\nDuring the passing of the weary hours her thoughts had travelled widely.\nNot only had she shuddered at the revelations of that day, and sickened\nwith horror for the future, but memories of the hateful past had pressed\nupon her with resolute persistency.\n\nAnd in that retrospect it seemed that bygone days had failed to show her\nthe uttermost possibilities of mental anguish. Not throughout the\nlong-protracted pain of striving against Lucinda Belmont's successful\nrivalry; not in that moment of humiliation and agony of spirit when\nMorris had bade her leave him for Tony; not the year of grinding poverty\nand overwork that followed--none of all this had brought the cruellest\nlast drops of the cup of misery so near her shrinking lips as did the\npresent hour. She knew now that she could taste of these final dregs by\none means only--by seeing her own deeds used as the weapon wherewith to\nshatter the happiness of the man she loved far more dearly then life.\n\n\"Geoff, Geoff, forgive me!\" she cried aloud, and buried her face in her\nhands.\n\nHow cruel it all seemed! Could it be mere chance that so often made a\nsport, a mockery, of just the highest hopes and prospects--of the\nsunshine of the present--of the sweetest amidst past memories? Hot\nrebellion awoke within her heart, so surely did it seem that some subtle\nmalignity, some deliberate spitefulness, had been at work shaping her\nlife from the very day of her birth, when she lost her mother, guiding\nand controlling events until they culminated in this coil of torment. Or\nperchance it had all been preordained by some Supreme Being as a test, a\nneedful trial. Yet again, may be, she, and Geoffrey too, were but\nworking out their own salvation, fated to endure in order to expiate\nevil wrought in some forgotten existence; that she ought to be resigned,\nand, rebelling no longer, to submit patiently to sorrow both for herself\nand for him.\n\nAh, mystery of suffering! Can blind mortal eyes pierce the veil? Can a\nheart torn with ardent earthly love find comfort in the shadowy dreams\nof philosophers or mystics?\n\nEvarne flung herself upon the couch, pressing her face despairingly into\nthe cushions. And in the blackness arose, clear and distinct, a mental\nvision of that little Temple of Sekhet far away in the land of Egypt.\nHow minutely could she recall the terrifying aspect of the goddess who\nheld dominion over Love, over its joy and its cruelty. Almost with the\nvividness of reality could she see those ominous features--that flat\nhead with its receding brow, beneath which no wise benevolence, no\ntender charity could ever find place. And in the mental picture, the\nnarrow gleaming eyes seemed reading the agony of her spirit with\nmalicious deliberation, the long lips were parted over sharp teeth with\na devilish smile of amusement and gratification.\n\nShe started erect and gazed around the familiar room, seeking to clear\nher mind of such spectres. But the train of thought was not to be got\nrid of so easily.\n\nSurely those long-dead priests of Egypt had been verily inspired when\nthey represented this divinity under the guise of a cat-headed creature?\nAh, \"Crusher of Hearts\" supreme, with your sheer delight in torturing\nall that falls helplessly within your power--with your eyes that have\nthe gift of seeing clearly how and where to strike when the vision of\nall others is dulled! But they should have given you cat's paws,\nSekhet--cruel, tearing talons concealed in sheaths softer than velvet!\n\nThere was surely the \"Mark of the Beast\" upon this fate that had\nbefallen her. After so many years of dull monotony, to be allowed once\nagain to behold prospects of the truest happiness--to enjoy so brief a\nspell of love and joy--just a taste of life's sweetest possibilities.\nThen this crushing blow, this darkening of the heavens, this blight upon\nthe earth, this upheaval of the depths!\n\nShe moved restlessly around the room for a few minutes, then wandered\nupstairs again. She longed for the temporary forgetfulness of sleep, but\nhow vain to seek it with a mind in so wild a turmoil. The very\natmosphere seemed stifling. Half lifting aside the dressing-table that\nstood before the window, she flung wide the lower sash, and bringing a\nchair, rested her folded arms upon the sill and gazed into the night.\n\nOut of doors all was quiet and peaceful indeed. The moon still rode\nhigh, flinging clear-cut fantastic shadows upon road and pavement. No\nsound was to be heard, no human being to be seen.\n\nYet the mere sight of the street brought a fresh pang to her already\noverburdened heart. While Philia was away posing at the Polytechnic Art\nclass that evening there had come a knock at the door which Evarne had\ndisregarded entirely. A second rap was treated with like contempt; the\noutside world with its demands was non-existent to her that night. But\nthe current of her thoughts had been disturbed, and at the third attempt\nshe became sufficiently interested in this perseverance to stand\nconcealed by the window-curtains to watch who went away.\n\nAfter a time a figure had appeared and walked slowly down the street. It\nwas Geoff himself. He had driven home with her at five o'clock, and\nhere, but a few hours later, was apparently already anxious for fresh\nnews. To see the road, brought this little incident vividly to her\nmemory. Was she to lose such care and devotion? And to think that\nGeoff--with all his kindness and unfailing tenderness towards the\nweakest living thing, his trust and his true love for herself--was to be\nnothing more than one of Sekhet's innumerable victims!\n\nShe dragged down the blind sharply, to shut out the sight of the road,\nthen made up her mind at least to lie down and strive to sleep. But\nearly risers were already abroad before her eyelids even closed, and she\nseemed scarcely to have lost consciousness before Philia aroused her.\n\nThe old woman had not been as blind to the girl's troubled state as\nEvarne supposed. Far from sleeping complacently all night, she had lain\nawake long, listening to the gentle footsteps in the house, grieving\nover the sorrow that had so evidently descended upon the one who was\ndearest to her of all the world. Thus her voice was quite apologetic as\nshe called out--\n\n\"I'm sorry to wake yer, my pet, but I've let yer sleep as long as ever\nis possible if you're goin' to be at that studio by nine. It's jist on\neight o'clock already.\"\n\n\"I'll get up at once,\" Evarne answered, and she went so far towards\ncarrying out her good intention as to immediately sit up in bed. But as\nthe memory of the events of the previous day came upon her, she promptly\nsank down again with a renewal of despair.\n\nBut although lamentation and fear were permissible in the night hours,\nwith the morning must come a renewal of courage and energy--so she told\nherself, at least; and with the determination of acting up to this\nresolution, sprang lightly out of bed, and, crossing the room, drew up\nthe blind.\n\nBut either the energy of her uprising after such a night, or the sudden\nblaze of morning light, rendered her suddenly dizzy. She shut her eyes\nand leant for a moment on the dressing table. When she opened them again\nthe first thing she saw was her own reflection in the mirror. She\nsurveyed it with stern disapproval. What a sight she was, with pale\ncheeks and those blue circles under the eyes! She looked every whit as\nugly as she felt--dazed and sleepy and silly. Suddenly she made up her\nmind to stay at home. There was no real need to call upon her resources\nuntil the evening brought the interview with Morris. She would avoid the\nunnecessary effort of concealing her distress and anxiety from Geoff.\n\nShe went out on to the landing, and, leaning over the banisters, called\nfor Philia. The old woman opened the door of the kitchen, from whence\nissued the hissing sound of frying.\n\n\"Bring me up a cup of tea--nice and strong. I don't want anything to\neat. I'm not going to the studio this morning.\"\n\nThen returning to her room, she sat down and wrote to Geoff.\n\n    \"DEAREST OF ALL,\n\n    \"Will you mind very much if I don't come to-day? I have had such\n    a restless night, it has made me look so ugly I don't want you\n    to see me. There's vanity! Really, I do feel quite unwell--not\n    actually ill, you know, but not up to posing. I feel sure I\n    should only break more precious vases, so I had better not come,\n    though it is hard not to see you for a whole day, my Geoff.\n\n                               \"Your lazy\n\n                                                           \"EVARNE.\"\n\nAs she took the tea from Philia's hands she gave her the note.\n\n\"Send this by district messenger. Go at once, there's a dear.\"\n\n\"Won't yer tell me what's the matter, my pet? It's all troublin' me, it\nis, straight.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to worry about in a bad night, is there, now? When you\ncome back don't wake me. I'm going to sleep again if I can.\"\n\nBut Evarne did not leave it to chance. When she had nearly finished her\ntea she produced a tiny blue bottle from the drawer of the\nwashing-stand, carefully counted out five-and-twenty drops, shook her\ncup round several times, then swallowed tea and chlorodyne together to\nthe last dreg. Lowering the blind she got back into bed and was soon\nfast asleep.\n\nIt was three o'clock before she descended to the sitting-room. On the\ntable was a cluster of sweet-peas and roses, together with a note.\n\n\"Did Mr. Danvers send these?\" she inquired, as she tore open the\nenvelope.\n\n\"'E brought 'em 'imself. My gosh, dearie, 'e is properly careful of you.\n'E knocked so soft I 'ardly 'eard 'im, and 'e looked that worried.\"\n\n\"So I've already started to grieve him,\" reflected Evarne grimly, as she\nproceeded to read his letter.\n\n    \"MY POOR PRECIOUS DARLING,\n\n    \"I can't tell you how terrible it is to me to think of you as\n    weak and suffering ... my bright-eyed, rosy-lipped Evarne. And I\n    feel that really it is all my fault in one way and another....\n    I'm sure it is not surprising that yesterday should have upset\n    you.... It's a delicate, sensitive soul, I know, for all the\n    glorious vitality of the flesh. Only get well quickly, my best\n    and dearest, and I'll guard you better in future. Get strong\n    quickly, for my sake, who love you so, and you shall have\n    permission to smash every vase in the studio to your heart's\n    content ... you darling!\n\n                                                            \"GEOFF.\"\n\nShe put this little note in the bosom of her gown, as she went out to\nthe kitchen in response to Philia's call to dinner.\n\nAfter the little meal she got out her drawing materials, and made some\npretence at working. But her pencil moved almost mechanically over the\npaper as her mind rehearsed all she could possibly find to say to\nMorris--the pleas, the arguments she could place before him to turn him\nfrom his present purpose. Slowly though time crept, she watched its\nsteady progress with dismay, and as the afternoon waned there arose\nwithin her an ever-increasing fear, not so much of the interview that\nloomed ahead, as of its result. She tried to force herself to think only\nhopefully regarding its issue, but all the time in her innermost\nconsciousness she seemed to know that failure was a foregone conclusion.\nHow futile to strive to alter Morris's set determination--above all\nwhen, for once in his life, he would be able to flatter himself that he\nwas standing firm in the cause of right and justice.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\n\n                              A FRESH VOW\n\n\nBy six o'clock the sedentary occupation had become too trying. Evarne\nchanged her dressing-gown for a coat and skirt, and went out.\n\nAll this erratic behaviour caused Philia not a little concern and alarm.\nAs a general rule Evarne was so very placid and level-headed, that this\ndisregard of all precedent, this wandering about in the dark and\nsleeping in the daylight, this neglect of work, meals at extraordinary\nhours, and all the rest of the disorganising of respectable routine, was\nnot an occurrence to be treated lightly. Still, in Philia's experience\nof human nature, directly a girl must needs go and fall in love,\ntroubles and upsets and excitements followed as an inevitable corollary,\nwhile calm quiet contentment took unto itself wings. Thus she did not\nconsider the root-cause of the present state of affairs to be enshrouded\nin unsolvable mystery. Although she was rather hurt at not being made a\nconfidante, she evinced no curiosity, being fairly satisfied that clouds\nof such a nature almost always pass away in due course.\n\nBut when half an hour later she answered a knock at the door and\ndiscovered Geoff, she greeted him with anything but an amiable\ncountenance.\n\n\"How is she now?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Guess she's better agin, for she's gorn out to git a breath o' fresh\nair. Will yer please to step in and wait. I dare say she would like to\nsee yer when she comes back.\"\n\nNeeding no second invitation, Geoff followed Mrs. Harbert into the\nhouse.\n\nThe pretty little sitting-room was full of Evarne's personality. Here\nwere the flowers he had brought her; here too were her books, her\ndrawing-board, her writing-case; there was the embroidered footstool on\nwhich she had sat during his previous visit. Everything sang to him of\nEvarne. There were the really charming pictures on the walls, signed\nwith her initials, that she had amazed him by showing as her own\nhandiwork. There was her little work-box, and across it lay the long\nstrip of embroidery on which he had seen her diligently creating silken\nblossoms. Moved by a sudden longing to hold in his hand something that\nshe had touched, Geoff picked up this and surveyed it with the minute\nscrutiny of an apparent connoisseur in art needlework.\n\nPhilia was speaking to him somewhat reproachfully. She imagined that\nnow, having the culprit under her thumb, she could, with all due regard\nfor politeness, give him a \"piece of her mind.\"\n\n\"I must tell yer first that I ain't bin told who it is worryin' my\npore gal, but I warrant if they'd bin 'ere to see 'er last night\nthey'd 'ave bin fair ashamed of themselves. She was roamin' the 'ouse\nlike a wanderin' spirit, and in the mornin' she was jist as white as\n'er nightgown. It seems to me that to make anyone really un'appy\nwithout rhyme or reason--and I won't believe Evarne is in the\nwrong--as I was sayin', to make anyone real miserable is a big thing\nto 'ave on one's mind in this 'ere world o' sin and woe, full o' the\nslings and arrers of houtrageous fortune as it is--Shakespeare! In\nplain talk, sir, a world where we're all certain to 'ave quite enough\ntrouble to digest without them as we cares for most forcin' a hextry\ndose down our gullets. And no stray flowers, nor even rings nor\nsich-like, makes up for unkindness--not to the noble mind--Shakespeare!\nI've lived with Evarne for five years and more, and she's never 'ad one\nhour's sorrow through my fault. Hexcuse me if I'm takin' liberties I\ndidn't ought, but you've bin 'ome from foreign parts less than a week,\nand for some reason or other now she's made fair miserable--by someone\nor other! I'm not sayin' by who, but it's very 'ard for me to see it and\nnot say nothin' at all.\"\n\nPhilia paused, somewhat apprehensive at having thus let her feelings\ncarry her away. But Geoff was not displeased by this ardent\nchampionship.\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Harbert,\" he said seriously, \"if it is my fault--and to a\ncertain extent I'm afraid it is--believe me that it was both\nunintentional and indirect. Evarne shall never have a moment's trouble\nthat I can save her from, be very sure of that.\"\n\nHe walked to the window and looked out.\n\n\"I wonder where she is now?\" he went on. \"Do you think she will be\nlong?\"\n\n\"Can't say where she is. She jist says, 'It's suffocatin' indoors,' she\nsays, and out she goes. Most likely she'll be back by seven. Anyway, I'm\ndue at the 'Poly' at 'alf-past.\"\n\n\"You've always posed, haven't you, Mrs. Harbert?\"\n\nPhilia was decidedly a trifle aggrieved by this query, and answered in\nwounded tones--\n\n\"Now, sir, if yer was a few years older, yer wouldn't need to ask that.\nThere was a time when every hartist in London knew all about\nPhiladelphia 'Arbert, and it wasn't sich a great time ago either.\"\n\n\"Evidently I don't know much?\" queried Geoff with a good-natured smile.\n\nThe reply was certainly cutting.\n\n\"You never 'eard tell of Philadelphia 'Arbert as a model, and you don't\nknow 'ow to keep yer sweet'eart's eyes dry. Well, sir, askin' yer\npardin', but you 'ave got somethin' to learn!\"\n\nThe young man bit his lip and did not answer. This silence melted his\noutspoken critic immediately, and she set to work to be amiable.\n\n\"Hexcuse me if I'm rather sharp, but it is 'ard to 'ave bin famous once\nand to find yer 'ard-earned fame all gorn. Why, I can remember the time\nwhen any hartist gentlemen as wanted to bring Venus or any other of them\n'eathen young women into a picture, didn't feel 'e'd done all he could\nto 'elp 'imself until 'e'd got me to pose for 'im. That's a fact, sir!\nI'd a lovely figger when I was a gal. None o' the young women now, only\nexceptin' Evarne, comes up to what models was in my young days, and\nI--well, my gosh! I've 'ad a long string o' great painters waitin' their\nturn till I was disengaged and could oblige.\"\n\n\"It must have been both pleasant and profitable to be in such demand.\"\n\nMrs. Harbert looked down with becoming modesty, and smoothed her apron\nas she replied--\n\n\"Well, sir, it was, but I never let myself get huppish about it. I was\nonly as the Lord chose to make me. I used to say sometimes, 'Beauty is\nas beauty does,' and 'Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good, a gloss, a\nglass, a flower; lost, faded'--I forget the rest--'within the\nhour'--Shakespeare. I've sat for Lord Leighton and Millais and Watts and\n'eaps of others.\"\n\n\"Then you have posed for some quite well-known pictures, I suppose?\"\n\n\"My gosh! a picture painted in those days, when Hart was properly\nunderstood, 'adn't much chance of bein' thought 'ighly of if the hartist\n'adn't taken care to git me to collaborate with 'im.\"\n\n\"Now, that's a really original idea of yours, Mrs. Harbert--that a\npainter and his model collaborate. Did you tell it to the men you sat\nfor, and what did they say?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, truth is, I doubt if any of the hartists that I've 'elped to\ngain positions they'd never 'ave got to without me, would be willin' to\nacknowledge it. But there, that's only the way o' the world. Shakespeare\n'e wrote a song about hingratitude, as I dare say you've 'eard sung.\"\n\n\"Isn't it very interesting to be able to look back on the famous\npictures you've posed for?\" inquired Geoff, with another fleeting glance\nout of the window.\n\n\"It is that! Why, I was that proud the first time I was in a picture\nthat was the 'it of the season. I was 'Harry--Harry--hadney.'\"\n\n\"Whom?\"\n\n\"Ain't yer never 'eard of 'er, pore gal? She's bin deserted on a island\nby some skulkin' brute, so she knelt down with next to nothin' on, and\n'eld out both 'er 'ands to the sea. It was like this.\"\n\nRendered enthusiastic by her reminiscences, Philia sank down on the\ncarpet, leant forward, flung back her head and imploringly extended both\nher hands. The effect had probably been charming when the model was\nyouthful and fair, but now it put a severe demand on Geoff's good\nmanners not to smile at the old dame.\n\n\"It was real touchin',\" she declared, as she rose to her feet with some\ndifficulty, \"but it nearly gave me 'ousemaid's knee! Then there was\nanother picture that made a lot o' talk. It was called the 'Race of\nHatalanta.' She was runnin' fit to catch the last train 'ome. I shan't\nforget that pose in a 'urry. My gosh, I can't even think of it without\nmy left leg beginnin' to ache!\"\n\nAt this moment the street door was heard to open. According to her usual\ncustom Evarne had let herself in with her latchkey.\n\n\"There she is,\" said Philia, and stepping out into the passage she\nannounced in somewhat triumphant tones, \"There's a gentleman 'ere\nwaitin' to see yer, dearie.\"\n\nAfter an interval of somewhat unaccountable duration, Evarne appeared in\nthe doorway. As she beheld Geoff her whole expression changed, her lips\nparted into a smile, her eyes lit up.\n\n\"Oh, it is you! I am so very glad, so delighted!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Well, I won't be hintrudin' no longer,\" declared Philia as she left the\nroom.\n\nBut her absence or presence was unmarked at that moment. Evarne was in\nGeoff's arms, and each was gazing at the other as if years of separation\nhad intervened between this moment and their last meeting.\n\n\"I am so very glad you have come,\" declared Evarne again. \"You cannot\ntell how badly I have wanted you. I felt as if I should die if I\ncouldn't see you! Do you know where I have been? No, how should you? I\nhave been to your studio! I don't mean upstairs, but I walked past and\nlooked up at the window. I hoped you might just happen to look out. I\ndid want you so much; I wanted comforting so badly.\"\n\n\"Evarne, every time I see you, you make me love you even more devotedly\nthan I did before. But how truly wicked to want to see me, and not send\na message at once. I have been thinking about you every minute of the\nday. Dearest, tell me, are you worrying so sadly about anything\nWinborough said?\"\n\n\"It is the whole thing--the whole business. Oh, why could you not have\nbeen poor? Why could not you have been just an ordinary person, so that\nwe could have lived for one another, without anyone having either the\nwish or the right to interfere? I am so afraid of your cousin--and worse\nstill, I know that everyone will be on his side. I feel the force of the\nentire world against me, and it's crushing.\"\n\n\"But we can safely defy the whole world to weaken our love for one\nanother, can't we, my best and dearest?\"\n\nShe wrenched herself suddenly from his arms.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know!--I don't know! How can we be sure of anything?\"\n\nSo saying, she flung herself down amid the cushions of the big velvet\narm-chair. Geoff stood motionless for a moment, then seating himself on\none of its wide arms, he leaned over, resting his hand upon the opposite\nside.\n\n\"Then know this henceforward, Evarne. You may with perfect confidence\ndefy not only the world, headed by Winborough, but you may safely defy\neven yourself to destroy the love I have for you. You might wound me,\nand disappoint me, even forget me, yet while I live I shall love you,\nand after death also, if Heaven pleases. What more can I say than that?\"\n\n\"Well, it's a very pretty sentiment, anyhow,\" was the lightly-spoken,\nalmost mocking reply.\n\n\"Then truth is not always ugly,\" he answered quietly enough, but Evarne\ncould see that he was not unmoved by her jeering tones. Impulsively she\nflung her arms around his neck, and drew his face down to hers.\n\n\"Geoffrey, I'm years and years--I'm centuries older than you in spirit.\nI have suffered so much in previous existences that my soul still\nretains its scars. Truth has always appeared to me so sad of\ncountenance, that when I see it with a smiling face I dread deception.\nYes, indeed. In my mind Truth is invariably so grim, so menacing, so\ndestructive, that when anything appears in beautiful guise and calls\nitself Truth, I instinctively mistrust it.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose I can do nothing but wait, and let time prove my words.\"\n\nA sudden impulse--a longing--seized Evarne to confess everything--there\non the spot, without any preparation or delay. To take him at his word,\nto shatter his ideal, and see if the love he thought so invincible could\nreally endure. What a triumphant answer to Morris--to meet him with\nGeoff by her side--Geoff knowing all, and unchanged by knowledge!\n\nShe sought for words with which to commence, but in the moment's\nhesitation she chanced to look full into his clear grey eyes. It was no\nuse. A cold chill seized her, and a feeling almost of physical sickness.\nShe was ashamed. It was impossible to find language for this task that\nher tongue could be brought to utter. She felt her cheeks flush red, and\npartly covered her face with her hand.\n\nSo much for this half-hearted attempt at confession. And as the impulse\npassed, a great thankfulness arose that she had not yielded to its\nwiles. That Geoff loved her now was as certain as that he lived, and at\nthat very moment she could feel his warm breath upon her brow. But he\nspoke with untried confidence. Had he not once declared, practically in\nso many words, that he would rather see her dead than have aught destroy\nhis love for her? He had, indeed, made an attempt to contradict himself\na moment later; but she held those words to be the genuine offspring of\ntruth--representative of his most usual frame of mind. No, her task was\nnot to anticipate, but to strive to ward off the evil hour of\ndisillusionment.\n\n\"My true lover,\" she murmured, \"I know you are faithful and loyal and\nconstant, and I believe you would be long-suffering. I trust you, depend\nupon you now, and rely upon you for the future without a single doubt or\na moment's hesitation.\"\n\n\"And, dearest, am I to feel the same about you? Will you be always\nfaithful and constant to me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Geoff, always, always.\"\n\n\"Then all is well. I half feared that if Winborough got a chance to talk\nto you alone, and perhaps bullied and argued and persuaded and appealed\nto your affection for me, and all that sort of thing, you might\nperchance be led to imagine that you were really ensuring my ultimate\nhappiness by going away and leaving no trace whereby I could discover\nyou again. One hears of such things, you know.\"\n\n\"If I thought it would be really best for you, be sure I would----\"\n\n\"Evarne, my dear--my dearest--remember----\"\n\n\"Yes, Geoff, I do remember, whatever it might be you were going to\nremind me of, for I forget nothing. I do believe I can make you happy.\nYou hear that? I firmly believe I can make your life happier than it\ncould be without me. That belief is the foundation of all my actions.\nWill you always remember that? Please take it into your very heart of\nhearts, and let it fix itself there indelibly.\"\n\nFor some time they sat silent. With Geoff so very near to her, Evarne\nbecame conscious of a gentle calm, a certain sense of peace, a\ndespondency that was mournful, but less desperate. It was with an effort\nthat she finally roused herself sufficiently to take his watch out from\nhis pocket and look at the time.\n\n\"Seven--seven o'clock and past!\" she sighed, replacing it. \"Ah me! You\nmustn't think, dear, that I'm dreadfully rude and inhospitable, but I'm\nafraid I must ask you not to stay any longer.\"\n\n\"Oh--h!\"\n\n\"It's no use saying 'oh' in that dolorous manner,\" she declared,\nsmiling. \"You see--it's this way--old Philia has to leave here for the\n'Poly' about seven. She will be going in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"But we don't mind, do we? We don't want the old lady.\"\n\nEvarne cast down her eyes. The only excuse that had crossed her mind for\ngetting Geoff out of the house struck her as being decidedly petty and\nunworthy.\n\n\"It is stupid, I know well; but people do talk so.\"\n\n\"Why, silly little Evarne, you are surely not bothering about Mrs.\nGrundy and the neighbours, are you?\"\n\nWith a somewhat feeble and shamefaced smile she rose up from out the\ndepths of the chair, and replied only by fetching his hat and offering\nit to him with a little curtsey.\n\n\"It's only till to-morrow. I shall come to the studio just as usual.\"\n\nThe young man took the proffered hat with undisguised reluctance.\n\n\"Of course, I cannot stay if my hostess turns me out thus firmly,\" he\ngrumbled, \"but I'm sure it is not necessary. I believe you're tired of\nme.\"\n\nShe shook her head confidently.\n\n\"I'm very sure you don't think that really.\"\n\nHis momentary ill-humour died away.\n\n\"Of course I don't, dear heart. I dare say you are in the right.\nEverything you do is perfect, only--I warn you--you will have to marry\nme sooner than ever for this. Can't you settle on a definite date by\nto-morrow? Do try.\"\n\nShe disregarded his question.\n\n\"I'm glad you're not vexed. You did frown at me, you did, and it made\nyou look--oh, terribly ugly--just like a medi\u00e6val gargoyle.\"\n\n\"You and Mrs. Harbert have certainly entered into a conspiracy with a\nview to reducing me to a proper condition of self-depreciation,\"\ndeclared Geoff, smiling at the lofty expression of disdain with which\nhis \"Sweet Lady\" was still surveying him. He shifted his hat from one\nhand to the other.\n\n\"Come out with me, Evarne. Let us go and have something to eat, and then\non to a theatre or somewhere, eh?\"\n\n\"I've still got the tiniest little headache; I would rather not,\" she\ndeclared. \"Good-bye, dearest.\" Then, correcting herself somewhat wildly:\n\"No, no. I didn't mean good-bye--only good-night! Don't speak ill-omened\nwords, Geoff. Only say good-night.\"\n\nAt length he was gone. Evarne pressed her hand to her forehead. This\nunexpected visit had both weakened and strengthened her.\n\nAfter a few minutes she went upstairs to change her dress. Hearing the\napproaching steps, Philia, who was in her own room tying on her bonnet,\ncalled out, and as the girl entered she inquired--\n\n\"Are yer any 'appier now, my pet? Is it all right?\"\n\n\"You really are fond of me, aren't you, Philia?\" queried Evarne\nmeditatively, without replying to the question she had been asked. Then,\nwithout waiting for any response to her own demand, she went on: \"Would\nyou mind doing a little errand for me? The classes at the 'Poly' end at\nten, don't they? Will you go afterwards to Edith Gordon's and ask her\nfor the blouse pattern she promised to lend me? It isn't very far out of\nyour way, and you can stop and have a chat if she is in, can't you?\"\n\n\"Right yer are,\" assented Philia cordially, and five minutes later the\ndoor had closed behind her.\n\nAt length the coast was quite clear for Morris's visit.\n\nEvarne carefully studied her three tea-gowns. It was an important point.\nThe green one was a great favourite with everybody, but it was\nundeniably getting old. The crimson cashmere with the black lace suited\nher splendidly, but both colour and material looked rather heavy for\nsuch hot weather. The pale yellow was the most suitable, and she would\nwear a harmonising cluster of sweet-peas.\n\nAlthough every nerve in her body seemed to be now on edge, she did not\nneglect the least detail of her toilette, and at its completion could\nnot but realise that she was indeed fair to behold. She had quite got\nback her colour, and that peculiar sparkling brilliance that was her\ncharacteristic beauty. Her luxurious dark hair, faintly scented and\npiled high upon her head, was held in place by ornamental combs. Long\nenamel earrings, gleaming blue and green, served to emphasise the soft\ncarnation bloom of the cheeks they hung against, while a brooch of the\nsame iridescent tones held together the lace at the point of the\nV-shaped opening of her gown. Then she put her diamond engagement ring\nupon her finger, and, after a final critical gaze into the mirror,\ndescended the stairs. There she drew the blinds and lit the lamp. It was\nfive minutes past eight. She sat down and waited.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXXVII\n\n                    EVARNE FIGHTS FOR MORE THAN LIFE\n\n\nThe silence was intense and oppressive; time dragged painfully; every\nminute was fraught with an entire round of mingled emotions. Fear and\ntrembling apprehension alternated with eager impatience; stem\ndetermination, coupled with either forced or spontaneous hope, would be\nfollowed by a crushing sense of foregone failure and lack of\nself-confidence. After a while this ceaseless ebullition of feeling\nbrought on actual physical fatigue, and Evarne leant back in her chair\nwith a growing sense of exhaustion.\n\nSuddenly a sharp, loud knock broke the silence. Although she had been\nexpecting this--listening and waiting for it--the sound came finally as\na blow dealt her highly-strung nerves. She gave a painful start, a gasp,\nand felt the hot blood surge to her head. She sprang to her feet at\nonce, but then stood motionless. Now that Morris Kenyon was actually\nupon her doorstep, every moment that kept him from crossing the\nthreshold seemed a priceless respite.\n\nShe believed that she remained as if spellbound for many minutes, but\nreally only a brief time passed before she aroused herself and went to\nthe front door. With apparent indifference she flung it half open, and\nat once returned to sink into her favourite big arm-chair, leaving\nMorris to enter, close the front door, and conduct himself along the\nhall.\n\nThe light streaming from out the one room into the darkness served as a\nguide, and in a minute she heard his advancing footsteps come to a\nstandstill. She neither spoke nor looked up, but remained impassive, her\neyes fixed on the beloved ring that sparkled upon her third finger.\n\nMorris seemed well content to stand for a while in the doorway,\nsurveying her with a keen scrutiny. Then he studied the surroundings,\nrapidly but with considerable interest; glanced over his shoulder into\nthe dense blackness that enveloped the remainder of the house; listened\na moment to the heavy stillness that held sway; then entered the room\nand closed the door, pausing calmly to admire the crimson velvet\nporti\u00e8re, on which was some of Evarne's exquisite embroidery. After\nlaying down his stick and hat on a little table and leisurely removing\nhis gloves, he drew up a chair close to his hostess, sat down, and\nwaited silently until she should choose to speak.\n\nHe was in evening dress, and though in the abstract there was nothing to\nbe surprised at in this sartorial detail, Evarne found it inexplicably\ndisconcerting. Without raising her eyelids she contrived to study him\nthrough her long lashes. He was indeed dignified and imposing; he had\nlost none of his good looks; but the lines of his mouth seemed even\nsterner, more inflexible than of yore. Past memories rushed upon her\nmind. The leading events and many apparently trifling details that had\ngone towards making up nigh three years of her life passed now in rapid\nprogression before her mind's eye.\n\nVerily she had loved this man at one time--she shrank with self-loathing\nfrom recalling how devotedly. He it was had been the cause of all those\nwild storms of emotion that from time to time had convulsed her whole\nnature in the throes either of ecstasy or of anguish. Quite apart from\nthe fact that he came at this crisis as the arbiter of her future fate,\nit would have been impossible for her to once more see him--to feel his\nnear presence--and remain entirely unmoved.\n\nMaybe some similar reflections passed through Morris's mind. At all\nevents, when ultimately he broke the silence, his words referred, not\ndirectly to the business on hand, but to the days that were gone.\n\n\"The presiding spirits at our exciting and interesting farewell,\nfive--six now, isn't it?--six years ago, were not exactly those of Peace\nand Harmony, were they? Where did the venturesome little birdie flutter\nwhen it left its gilded cage, and what did it do?\"\n\nConsidering the gravity of the circumstances to which he was alluding,\nthis light mode of address aroused all Evarne's indignation. But she\ncarefully concealed every trace of resentment. So far her behaviour\ntowards him that evening had been decidedly cavalier; but it was\nundoubtedly necessary, if she was to win her way with him, that he\nshould be deferred to--conciliated, rendered as well disposed towards\nher as was possible. Thus she gently answered his question by a brief\nthough absolutely frank recital of her short stage experience, her\nmiseries at needlework and subsequent illness, and her ultimate success\nas an artist's model. She kept very much to generalities in this account\nof how the years had passed with her, and avoided the least mention of\nGeoffrey.\n\nMorris listened with evident interest, and after a period of silence had\nshown that she did not intend to proceed to further details, he said\ncarelessly--\n\n\"You've escaped monotony in life, at all events. But, indeed, some new\nexperiences have come the way of nearly everybody you once knew. Tony\nBelmont married, and is now a respectable, sober citizen with two\nchildren. Lucinda is still in Paris, assailing hearts and banking\naccounts with undiminished success--not mine, though! Little--whatever\nwas her name? Oh, Feronnier! A man who once knew her told me he had seen\nher recently haunting the back streets with a face pitted by small-pox!\nI, to my own vast surprise, find myself, _nolens volens_, an earl! My\nlady-wife, the countess, grows more tenacious of life year by year. I\nshould say also she has become more disagreeable and unpleasant daily,\nif she hasn't already arrived at an age when ugliness and unpleasantness\nin the fair sex are such that there's no distinguishing of degrees. Then\nGeoffrey Danvers finds himself my heir, with all the resultant\nprivileges and drawbacks--amongst the latter being the dire necessity of\nmarrying not merely to please his own fancy, but with a certain regard\nto the demands of his position.\"\n\nAt length this preamble had been manoeuvred round to the main point.\n\nEvarne leaned slightly forward in her anxiety, as she demanded, without\nany circumlocution--\n\n\"Morris, do you wish to prevent your cousin making me his wife?\"\n\nUnconsciously she held her breath while awaiting his reply.\n\n\"Surely such a question needs no answer?\" he said, a certain sternness\nstealing into his voice. \"My chief wonder is that you ever dared to\nthink of marrying my cousin.\"\n\nExplanation seemed but a waste of time, yet she found herself saying in\na somewhat tremulous voice--\n\n\"But I didn't know. They all speak of you by your title, and I did not\ndream of connecting that name with you. I never saw anything about the\nmatter in the papers. Five years ago I was doing needlework; I read\nnothing and knew of nothing that happened outside my own four walls.\"\n\n\"Um! I understand,\" rejoined Morris reflectively. Then with a sudden\nchange of tone he continued--\n\n\"Now, see here. You must realise that, as things have turned out, this\nmarriage is not to be thought of. While no one who has ever known you,\n_ma ch\u00e9rie_, can possibly connect Evarne and common sense together in\ntheir minds, you are experienced enough by now, I dare say, to be\nwilling to admit that life has the drawback of being a serious affair,\nand not a pretty romance. Therefore you will surely see that the wisest\nthing you can do is to make the best of a bad job, to accept the\ninevitable, and--shall we say--travel a while? Now, travelling costs\nmoney, and it is only fair that I, who am responsible for the necessity,\nshould pay the piper. There's a cheque in my pocket-book, Evarne. If you\nwill tell me what you think would be sufficient to--to settle up things\ncomfortably--I will fill it in right away. Now, that's merely a business\noffer, to avoid trouble and annoyance for us both,\" he added hastily,\nnoticing her changed expression. \"I don't need any thanks, but at the\nsame time I don't intend to put up with any of the abuse to which you\ntreated me the last time I proposed concerning myself about your future.\nNow, what sum will satisfy you? In any case you must realise that your\nmarriage with Geoffrey is absolutely impossible.\"\n\nEvarne lay back in the big chair and surveyed the speaker leisurely and\ncritically. She was at a loss to decide on the best manner of refusing\neven to consider this suggestion. One variety of response after another\nflitted through her mind. She dared venture on none of them. She dreaded\nthe effect her defiance would have upon him, declare it gently and\nmeekly as she might. Finally words came, prompted by her protracted\nscrutiny of his cold, resolute face. A quivering sigh escaped her, and\nspeaking half to herself she murmured--\n\n\"How much I have suffered at your hands!\"\n\nFor a moment his sympathy was aroused. He drew his chair a trifle\ncloser, and laid his hand upon her knee.\n\n\"Evarne, why in Heaven's name do such things happen? On my honour, I'm\nheartily grieved and worried over this imbroglio.\"\n\nWith hope flashing into her eyes she suddenly sat erect and caught at\nhis arm.\n\n\"Then leave everything alone--dear, dear.\"\n\nHer mellifluous voice was low and coaxing. Before he could reply she\nwent on--\n\n\"Let all the cruel, hateful past be forgotten. I can--I will--be a good\nwife to Geoff. You should never, never have the least reason to regret\nhaving permitted our marriage--oh, I'm certain! We are so strangely\nsuited to one another--our natures are thoroughly harmonious. Oh,\nMorris, Morris, you don't know how much he cares for me, and I--I love\nhim with my whole heart, with all my strength, with all that makes my\nlife. We should be so happy together--do let it be.\"\n\nMorris raised his hands, as if to request the opportunity of replying.\nBut Evarne did not, perhaps could not, cease one instant in her\nimpassioned appeal.\n\n\"You know better than almost anyone that I am not light-natured, or\nreally indifferent to right and wrong. You did care for me once--I know\nit--and there was a time when I would have turned to you with perfect\nconfidence in any trouble. By the memory of those days, I implore you\nnot to drag me again into the lowest depths of misery. And Geoff\ntoo--pity him, and spare him. Let him live his own life, and love in\npeace, and marry as his heart dictates. You can't always go by hard and\nfast laws. I am sure, I am convinced, that the greatest good--that\nnothing but good--could ever come from your keeping silence upon the\nwrongs, the faults, the deceptions and miseries that have gone by. Only\nfresh harm, more widespread evil, immediate and life-long, irreparable\nand unnecessary--oh think, so unnecessary--can arise from your\ndetermination to oppose a marriage that would be--be.... Oh, Morris, we\ndo love each other so much!\"\n\nShe flung her whole soul into this plea. As so often happens, the actual\nwords were by far the weakest part of the appeal. It was her voice,\nlow-pitched in its earnest entreaty, and at times quivering and\nuncertain, that betrayed most clearly the depth of her agitation--the\nvital force of tortured feelings. And as these tremulous tones died\naway, her entire personality continued to give the impression that her\nvery life hung upon Morris's response. She leaned towards him; her fair\nface, so expressive, so appealing, was very close to his. Those eager\nbrown eyes, now so full of passionate persuasion, seemed to burn to his\ninnermost consciousness. Not for one moment could Morris doubt the\nreality of her deep affection for the man she desired to marry.\n\nHe admired total abandonment of any sort. Something of her old charm\nfell upon him, and for a passing moment he came near to envying his\nyoung cousin the possession of this all-dominating love that he himself\nhad once so lightly flung aside and disregarded. Thus, besides the need\nof resisting the encroachment of sentiment upon his resolve, he felt a\ntouch of jealousy--a decided though unacknowledged displeasure at\nfinding the heart that was once his footstool now so entirely\nemancipated from his service. It was this sense of personal grievance\nthat caused him to answer her with a dash of that brutality that came so\neasily to his lips.\n\n\"The saints protect me from the responsibility of disarranging any ideal\nunion, but the one you suggest is in every way about as unsuitable as\ncould possibly be imagined. Doubtless you are absolutely devoted to\nGeoffrey--thousands of girls could easily adore the heir to an earldom.\nBut forget your charming romantic feelings and try to look at the matter\nfrom an impersonal point of view. You are an artist's model. It may be\nthe most refined and elevating profession imaginable, but--well--we\ncommonplace people who belong neither to the race of poets nor artists\nfind it rather difficult to reconcile--well--you comprehend? I won't\npress that point.\"\n\n\"That is nothing at all to Geoff!\" breathed Evarne.\n\n\"Then, if I understood rightly, you came very near to including utter\nstarvation in that intensely interesting recital of your experiences,\"\nhe went on. \"Of course, that's very sad--quite touching, in fact. But\nnow, do you suppose that a few years ahead we want troops of American\ntourists trotting out to the slums to visit the garret wherein the\nCountess of Winborough nearly starved? I can assure you that, although I\nshan't be here, I object very strongly to the possibility. Oh, Geoffrey\nthinks he wouldn't mind, I dare say. I only wonder he hasn't already\npainted a picture of you in rags and tatters gazing into a cupboard like\nold Mother Hubbard and labelled it 'Suffering Virtue.' That's his belief\nabout you, isn't it?\"\n\nEvarne felt her whole body tingling with hot indignation. She rose\nimpetuously from the arm-chair, and walked rapidly to the farther end of\nthe room. Such was the overwhelming hatred of this man that awoke again\nwith renewed power within her breast, that his near presence was not to\nbe endured.\n\n\"And isn't it true?\" she demanded, speaking quickly and with impassioned\nemphasis. \"Is not the very phrase that you are mean and base enough to\nfling at me in derision nothing more nor less than Heaven's truth? Is it\nnot entirely because I did indeed prefer my own self-respect to\nill-gotten money that there is a showplace in London such as you\ndescribe? That squalid room, and the cruel ordeals I underwent within\nits walls, are the very witnesses that testify to my claim to be held a\ngood woman and a fit wife for any man. Not a day passed without my\nenduring more than you can ever realise. I was entirely without hope for\nthe future, yet never once--never once, I tell you--did I regret the\nchoice I had made.\n\n\"That grinding poverty was no shame to me,\" she went on, \"but a glory;\nand no one knows that better than you--you, Morris Kenyon! And I would\ngo back to it--live and die in it--rather than lose my own consciousness\nof virtue. You despicable coward! How dare you come here and taunt me\nwith humiliations for which you alone are responsible? Everything that\nis degrading and wretched in my life has been brought into it by you.\nYou indeed did your best to turn me into a woman whom a man well might\nfear to entrust with his name and with his honour, but that garret cries\nout to you and to all the world the story of your failure. It is\ninfamous--vile--to bring forward such an acceptance of poverty as a\nreason for opposing your cousin's choice of me as his wife. It is\ninfamous, and you know it.\"\n\nShe paused, breathing hard, still struggling with a sense of outrage.\nHer words had not been devoid of a certain sting, and once or twice\nMorris had inwardly winced beneath the onslaught. But circumstances\nplaced every advantage--every weapon of lasting keenness--into his\nhands. Thus it was with unruffled complacency that he declared--\n\n\"My dear Evarne, could you not contrive to conquer this tendency to wax\nmelodramatic? You know I dislike it, and that it is always ineffective.\"\n\nHe waited a minute, half expecting her to answer. But obedient to his\nexpressed will Evarne succeeded in stifling all retorts, and remained\nsilent. Looking at her narrowly, he could see signs of the effort she\nmade over herself, and smiled a little before he continued--\n\n\"You force me to speak more plainly than I had hoped would be necessary.\nSurely you must know that I do not really need to adduce any exterior or\nsubsequent details of your career in support of my very natural\nobjection to this marriage. The one fact of your having been my mistress\nis alone all-sufficient. Understand that, please! You calmly ask me to\nallow Geoffrey to walk blindly into the trap you have set for him, and\nhurl insults at my head when I refuse! I should like to know what you\nexpected? Did you really believe I should become a party to this\ndeceit?\"\n\nBut again he received no answer. Evarne simply looked at him with eyes\nthat had grown somewhat dilated.\n\n\"I know he is absolutely without any suspicion,\" Morris went on, \"for\nonly yesterday the poor fool spoke of you in a strain that almost caused\nme to laugh in his face.\"\n\nIt needed such words, uttered in tones of such supreme contempt, to\nbring home to Evarne the way in which others must view the position in\nwhich she had placed Geoffrey. The knowledge assailed her cruelly. A\nphysical pain, keen as a knife, shot through her forehead from one\ntemple to the other. Crossing to the sofa, she sat down, twisted her\nhands tightly together, shut her eyes, and waited while the sharp pang\ngradually passed away.\n\nWithout turning right round, Morris was no longer able to see her.\nAccordingly, he got up and sank into the arm-chair she had vacated. But\na minute later Evarne was on her knees by his side. The new horror that\nhis last words had aroused, goaded her into making yet another effort at\npersuasion. Leaning against the soft, wide arm of the chair, she cried\nsomewhat wildly--\n\n\"No, I haven't told him, because somehow the occasion never seemed to\ncome until he loved me so much that I couldn't endure to speak the cruel\ntruth. And you mustn't tell him now, Morris--oh, you mustn't! If only\nyou will keep silent, neither he nor anybody else will ever know.\"\n\n\"So you flatter yourself, but these things always leak out.\"\n\n\"This wouldn't--how could it? We were abroad practically all the\ntime--no one here knows. Besides, nobody at all can be really certain.\nThere was always the veil of a plausible explanation of our being\ntogether. You didn't pick me up from nowhere. My father left me in your\ncharge--everyone at Heatherington knew that. I worked steadily at Art\nall the time. There is scarcely the remotest possibility of anyone ever\ntrying to make mischief; but if they did, then you and I together could\nabsolutely defy them. We could, couldn't we? Morris, I beg of you--I\nimplore your mercy--keep my secret. It can be done, and I am sure----\"\n\nBut Morris interposed.\n\n\"It is not a bit of use continuing, my dear. Such a proceeding on my\npart would be most dishonourable towards my cousin.\"\n\n\"It would be the truest kindness to him. And have I no claims upon your\nhonour? Will it allow you to betray me without scruple? Do you owe me no\nconsideration whatsoever?\"\n\n\"You view everything in a totally false light, Evarne. You don't seem to\nunderstand the difference----\"\n\n\"Of course I know Geoff is infinitely more important than I am; but it\nis for his sake--that's what you won't see and believe. But----\"\n\n\"Now, _ma ch\u00e9rie_, it's no use arguing. There is really nothing more to\nbe said on the matter, so don't let the morning milkman find us still\nwasting breath. It is absolutely impossible that I can stand by and\nwatch my cousin run blindly into a marriage with--well--with you! I\nthink you really owe me some thanks for not enlightening him\nimmediately. The fact is, I've always been ridiculously yielding and\nconsiderate where you are concerned, and the thought flashed across me\nyesterday that you might prefer to choose your own method of breaking\nwith him. Now, what about--about that cheque, little girl? There's no\nreason why you shouldn't make an excellent marriage yet. The world is\nwide. They say American men make good husbands, and I will give you my\nblessing in anticipation.\"\n\nEvarne remained silently musing for several minutes. Morris augured well\nfrom this, and did not interrupt her train of thought. At length she\nasked, in tones not devoid of a slight tinge of bitterness--\n\n\"And am I expected to thank you for all your kindly consideration?\"\n\nHe merely shrugged his shoulders.\n\nSomewhat to his surprise she answered quietly--\n\n\"Very well. I do thank you for keeping my secret so long, and for your\noffer of money, which I can well believe you mean simply as a kindness.\"\n\n\"Ah! And you decide...? What are you going to do now?\"\n\n\"I am going to marry Geoffrey Danvers.\"\n\n\"Evarne!\"\n\nMorris was decidedly taken aback by this calm yet resolute response.\nEvarne rose from her knees, and sitting down continued--\n\n\"Yes, I am going to become his wife, and you shall never persuade me\ninto telling him what I know well must cause him such profound sorrow.\nNot that it would make any lasting perceptible difference if you did\nbetray me. You have no idea--for _you_ can have no comprehension--of how\ndeeply he and I love. I don't really think it lies within your power to\nrealise the depth--such--such sincerity of affection. I am perfectly\nconvinced that he would remain true to me, despite a far worse tale than\nyou could tell.\"\n\n\"You don't really credit that romance. This attempt to marry him with a\nlie upon your lips proves you to be afraid of the effects of the truth.\"\n\n\"You're partly right, I admit; but I do not fear that Geoff would cease\nto care for me. Love is not killed so easily--don't think it.\"\n\n\"I know differently.\"\n\n\"You know absolutely nothing at all about love! Nothing!\"\n\n\"Well, I certainly cannot prophesy upon the delicate topic of my\ncousin's affections with anything approaching your delightful assurance.\nProbably he would suggest that he should occupy the same position\ntowards you that I did once, but I'm quite convinced----\"\n\n\"Heaven save me from ever hearing such a proposition from Geoff's lips.\nBut I know he never would.\"\n\n\"As I was about to say, I am perfectly convinced that he would never\nmarry you--would never wish to! Good gracious! what do you take him\nfor?\"\n\nEvarne gave a little cry.\n\n\"And then--and then--what then? Think of the struggle--the bitter\nanguish. Morris, Morris, do realise the cruel blow it would be to him.\nOh, it must be warded off! I cannot even think of it with anything like\ncalmness.\"\n\nAnd indeed, even as she spoke, the growing pallor upon her cheeks\nsupported her assertion. She rose from her chair.\n\n\"I will not have this evil deed of so-called friendship done to him. Do\nyou hear? You are not to tell him. If you do, I shall deny it utterly.\nDo you hear?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid the loudest shouting must prove as impotent as the most\npersuasive of tones to drown the voice of my conscience in this matter,\"\ndeclared Morris, looking unmistakably self-righteous. Disregarding the\nscornful little laugh with which this sentiment was received, he went\non--\n\n\"Really, Evarne, your morals are decidedly eccentric. But you require\nplain speaking, don't you? Well, then, they are absolutely infamous.\nEverything you say only serves to confirm my original determination.\"\n\nBoth his voice and his look carried conviction. Waves of wild grief, of\nhopeless, crushing despair, swept over Evarne's spirit, followed by the\nmost intense hatred and bitter indignation. Her caution demolished by a\nsense of utter failure, she placed no restriction upon the expression of\nher deep-rooted resentment against this man who had ever been her evil\ngenius. She stood close to him, one hand spasmodically gripping the back\nof the chair from which she had arisen, while her eyes, always\nbrilliant, now fairly blazed with anger and enmity.\n\n\"I shouldn't deny it--no, indeed. But from my lips he should learn the\nwhole truth--the entire shameful story. He should know how my father on\nhis very deathbed gave me--still a child--into the keeping of his false\nfriend. Surely it will be easy to realise that, when in my hour of loss\nand loneliness you came professedly to help and comfort me, I\nunhesitatingly entrusted myself and the guidance of my life into your\nhands. Was I blameworthy so far? But oh, what a cruel fate for any\ngirl!\"\n\n\"You had a very good time, my dear,\" interposed Morris testily.\n\n\"A good time!\" she echoed wildly. \"Oh! You know, and Geoffrey shall know\nhow, from the very first, you systematically tricked and deceived me,\nlying to me about your wife, and taking me alone with you to Naples.\nWill it seem strange to him to learn that in time you were able to make\nme care for you as blindly as I trusted you? I shall tell him how you\nworked upon all that was best in my nature--how you appealed to my\nsympathy--how you played upon my gratitude, my affection, to gain your\nown vile ends. I shall tell him all your infamy. You cast me among\nabsolutely depraved women--meaning me to become as they were; for\nfinally you bade me sell myself for money! Yes, you would have\ndeliberately started me on that path which is held to be the most\ndegrading--the most cruel--of all the tracks that lead hellwards. That's\nwhat you did for me, an innocent child; and that's what you would have\ndone, could you have had your entire will with me! My God, how I hate\nyou! and the man who loves me shall hate you too. But for me he shall\nfeel only a new, a different, a more desperate love. Now, then--send for\nhim this very hour--do you think there is any trace of doubt or fear in\nmy heart? I defy you absolutely--you most vile creature! Tell him--tell\nhim all you can, and let him judge between us. What cause have I to fear\nyou, or anything that such as you can say? The life you lead, the evil\nyou do, is repulsive in the eyes of every decent-thinking man. You to\ntalk of honour--hypocrite, hypocrite!  Having ruined first my good name,\nthen my every happiness, when both in turn were in your power, you come\nnow, and under the pretence of immovable devotion to honour, calmly\npropose to sweep away everything that makes my life worth living. You\noffer me money, and think I'm going to creep away overwhelmed and\nsilenced. I have promised Geoffrey to be ever true and loyal to him; I\nshall keep my word!  Send for him immediately if you desire, and let him\ndecide between us.\"\n\nMorris likewise stood up before he answered. His brows were contracted\nin a steady frown, yet the first thing he did was to break into a little\nscornful laugh. Then he spoke, and his voice was tense with anger.\n\n\"Make out as touching a legend as your imagination can devise, yet your\nown lips will condemn you. Would you not be forced to admit that you\nbelonged to me willingly enough until I grew tired of you? Be very sure\nthat after once acknowledging that single fact, the whole of your\nembroideries and explanations--all your heroics--would but fall on deaf\nears. I know Geoffrey a great deal better than you can do; you've only\nseen one side of his nature, and that, I can understand, may easily have\ngiven you an exaggerated idea of your sway over him. Haven't you found\nout yet that, honourable and straightforward himself, he is impatient of\ndeceit and trickery and double-dealing?\"\n\nShe interposed with a little cry of anguish: \"Oh! Morris!\"\n\nUnheedingly he went on.\n\n\"Truthful, Geoffrey is out of sympathy with liars; good-natured and\nquiet though he be, it is only safe to impose on him up to a certain\npoint. You fondly hope you could melt the anger and repulsion your\nconfession would inevitably create by means of easy tears and specious\npleadings. I very much doubt it. Do you think he is totally devoid of\npride and self-respect and firmness? What leads you to suppose that he\nwould be satisfied with soiled goods? Do you really believe that the\nknowledge that he is not first with you will merely give him a sort of\nsentimental heartache--more or less violent--that will pass away once he\ngets used to the notion? Do you think that he would ever forget that\nevery kiss of his wipes off one of mine? Do you dare hope you would not\nlose all value in his estimation once he learnt that his own cousin, for\none, knows exactly the nature of the words you speak--the look that\ncomes into your eyes--all your pretty little ways when you are most\ndeeply lost in love? Why should you think he is devoid of the desire for\nexclusive possession? For my part, knowing him and his high-flown\nideals, I fancy he could no longer endure the sight of you once he\nrealised what you have been--that there is no mystery about you upon\nwhich he cannot gain enlightenment for the asking--that however\npassionately he may hold you in his arms, others have----\"\n\n\"Stop, Morris! stop!\"\n\nThe words, simple in themselves, rang out wildly in mingled entreaty and\ncommand. They were fraught with the arresting power of a great anguish,\nand left behind them a trail of dead silence, in which nerves were\nthrilled and hearts beat faster.\n\nEvarne stood motionless for a minute, both hands stretched out in mute\nappeal; then, groping her way somewhat unsteadily to the sofa, she flung\nherself down, hiding her distorted face in the cushions. But Morris had\nnot finished yet. He too crossed the room, and stood by the side of the\nprostrate figure.\n\n\"You shall never marry my cousin--understand that once for all. Never!\nDo you think I shall submit to see him sacrificed to the plots of a\ndesigning woman? I advise you not to venture on another bout with me. I\ncan assure you I've retained no pleasant recollections of your temper\nand your impertinence. Now, I'll give you some money, and in twenty-four\nhours you must go. Surely you can see the game is up? Do you agree?\"\n\nHe received no verbal answer, but the head buried in the cushions was\nslightly shaken.\n\nMorris found this obstinacy exasperating beyond endurance.\n\n\"What a fool you are, Evarne!\" he cried roughly. \"What do you want to\nstop for? You can't surely think you will pull off that marriage? Do you\nfancy you could make yourself out to be merely a sort of martyr--an\ninteresting victim? Absurd! Don't think Geoffrey would be so dull as not\nto realise that in all probability I have already had successors.\"\n\nEvarne sprang to her feet and faced him, her eyes flashing, both her\nhands pressed against her breast.\n\n\"I thought you had said your very worst--you merciless monster! You, who\nknow so well why I left Paris, almost penniless, to starve. You do not\nbelieve your own foul words--liar, slanderer!\"\n\nHe put his hand firmly on her shoulder.\n\n\"Don't talk rubbish to me. Everyone knows 'it's easy to take a slice\nfrom a cut loaf.' If Geoffrey had not been so ridiculously strait-laced,\nhe too could have got all he wanted without any of this stupid talk\nabout marriage. At last you've forced me to tell you exactly what I\nthink of you, and I hope you're satisfied! You know now what I should\nhave to tell that poor boy, so had you not better come to terms with\nme?\"\n\nEvarne clenched her teeth ferociously, and, with a low inarticulate cry,\nsharply struck Morris's hand from off her shoulder. He made an angry\ngesture, but returning to the arm-chair sat down quietly. Once more she\nfelt that blind fury, that strange blackness and loss of consciousness,\nstealing over her mind to which she had succumbed six years ago. But now\nshe resisted its domination with all her power. Had she not Geoff to\nremember? She pressed her lips with such desperate violence against the\nring he had given her, that the sharp stones inflicted a tiny cut. It\nwas merely trifling, yet the pain served to recall her to herself to\nsome extent. But she neither could nor would make any effort to guard\nher speech as she turned upon her traducer. Her very voice sounded\nstrange to her own ears, and she herself was totally unaware of what she\nwas about to utter until the words had already rung out.\n\n\"It's none of it true--you know it's not true--you know it! You must\nnever repeat to Geoffrey any of the abominable things you've said this\nevening. It would kill me--I mean it--I have been hardly able to endure\nit alone! I know well you have no pity. How earnestly have I appealed to\nthat, again and again, always vainly? You never have mercy. But--listen!\nAre you not afraid of going too far at last, of driving me to\ndesperation? I warn you now. You will tell such evil truth and such\nmalicious lies at your peril. If you do thereby succeed in separating me\nand Geoff, I shall have nothing left to wish for but revenge.\"\n\n\"You're getting theatrical again. Now, Evarne, Evarne!\"\n\n\"Don't trifle! I warn you, it will be wiser of you to stay your hand. If\nyou do finally ruin my life--if you do thus remorselessly torture Geoff\nfor our ill-deeds--you'll have done the worst for me that lies within\nthe power of man. You will have destroyed all fear of any further\nsuffering that Heaven or earth could inflict. I tell you I should be\nmad, and sooner or later you should be repaid. Yes, I warn you, Lord\nWinborough, it will be safer for you to avoid setting loose the devil\nthat is in me. You guard my secret--that's all I ask. I've hated you for\nyears; now my loathing of you is nigh as strong as is my love for Geoff.\nI'm not the sort of woman to be defied with impunity. If you make me\nyour active enemy I shall stop at nothing. You can believe that, can't\nyou? I would shoot you like a dog, or stab you in the dark and glory in\nit, caring less than nothing for consequences.\"\n\nMorris was certainly no coward, yet he quailed before the white,\nmenacing face, in which two blazing eyes shone like beacon-fires,\nsending forth their warning of danger. He could well believe not only\nthat Evarne at the moment fully meant all she said, but that she might\nindeed act upon her avowed intention in the future. Inwardly cursing the\nbad luck that had led him ever to become entangled with this resolute\nand determined little fury, he said, without the least outward sign of\napprehension--\n\n\"So you are actually threatening me! You must be mad already!\"\n\nHe crossed the room and took up his hat, but Evarne barred his further\nprogress. Flinging herself upon her knees, she clung to the door-handle\nwith a tenacious grip, and made a final frantic appeal.\n\n\"You mustn't go--Morris, you mustn't go. I shall keep you here. You're\ngoing to Geoffrey now--I know it. You shall not. You can't drag me away\nfrom this door, and I shall stay here until you promise not to go to\nhim. Oh, you can strike me, or anything you like--I don't care, but I\nshan't move. Listen, Morris--do listen to me. I implore you--spare me.\nOh, I'm afraid--I'm afraid of the future and what may come. I didn't\nrealise before how absolutely unendurable it would be for Geoff to know.\nYou mustn't tell him--I'd sooner die straight away--now--and so keep my\nsecret. Morris, Morris, think of all I've endured, and spare me\nfurther--spare me this--spare Geoff--spare yourself! What can I\nsay--what can I do? Oh, Heaven help me!\"\n\nA protracted silence ensued, in which Evarne made tremendous mental\nefforts to regain complete control over herself. She felt it to be\nnecessary, and difficult though the task was in such a limited space of\ntime, she practically succeeded. At all events she conquered outward and\napparent calm, and rose from her knees, though still standing with her\nback pressed against the door. When she spoke next it was in strangely\nsmooth and even tones, and with a look that was merely questioning.\n\n\"Tell me truly, Morris, do you dislike Geoff? Do you not feel resentful\nbecause he is so much younger than you are, and is to come after you in\nplace of a son? No one can possibly realise more clearly than you do\nwhat it must mean to a man to learn about the woman he desired to marry\nsuch a story as you have to tell about me, yet you will not hold your\npeace. No law of right or justice can defend your thus forcing Geoff to\nshare the misery consequent upon our past sin. You must surely have some\nreason for wishing him ill?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my chief object is to save him from the protracted\nmiseries of an unhappy marriage, and incidentally to guard against his\nson--my future successor--being born of an unsuitable mother.\"\n\n\"I see. _Noblesse oblige_. Do you mean to say that if Geoff and I had\nbeen already married before you returned to England, you would not have\nremained silent?\"\n\n\"It is scarcely worth discussing an imaginary case, is it?\"\n\n\"But tell me.\"\n\n\"My dear girl, I don't know! Possibly. Indeed, I may even say probably.\nAs a matter of fact, I'm really attached to the boy. If the evil had\nbeen beyond prevention I certainly might have seen fit to keep your\nsecret. Even now, since my only aim is to prevent your marriage with\nhim, if you prefer to go away without making any explanation, I give you\nmy word that he shall never know details.\"\n\n\"Morris, Morris, must you tell him anyhow? Is it quite inevitable?\"\n\n\"Yes, he must be told--that is to say, the engagement must be broken\noff. If you prefer to do the job yourself, by all means let it be so.\"\n\n\"You won't go to him to-night?\"\n\n\"I will say nothing until this time to-morrow. Perhaps you will have\nmade up your mind to take the right course yourself before then. I'm\nsorry, but that's the limit of what I can do for you.\"\n\n\"No, no, give me longer,\" she implored.\n\nHer lips quivered, causing Morris to fear that this period of calmness\nmight not be long sustained.\n\n\"Well, I'll give you two days,\" he agreed. \"But it cannot possibly be\nallowed to continue longer than that. That's forty-eight hours too\nlong.\"\n\n\"Is that a promise?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Now stand aside from the door, there's a good girl.\"\n\nAs she obeyed silently, he stepped out into the passage. \"Go to bed, _ma\nch\u00e9rie_,\" he advised. \"Have a good night. You'll feel better in the\nmorning.\"\n\nImpatiently she signed to him to be gone, then flung herself into her\nfavourite chair, rested her elbows on one of its arms, and supported her\nchin on her hands. Thus she sat motionless, gazing fixedly into vacancy\nwith hard, dry eyes, forgetful or regardless of Morris's presence in the\nopen doorway.\n\nHe lingered a few moments, looking with mingled feelings at her now\nexpressionless but perfect-featured face and graceful form. But she\nneither spoke nor glanced in his direction, and very soon the street\ndoor had closed behind him with a final bang.\n\n\n\n\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n                              CONFIDENCES\n\n\nTime passed, and still Evarne sat motionless--thinking, thinking. In the\nfirst dreadful minutes of solitude she had been conscious of very little\nsave cruel, crushing despair, the most abject hopelessness. Her one\nother clearly defined idea had been that she must not, dare not, allow\nthe wild paroxysm of anguish that was rending her brain, to get the\nmastery over her will-power. Fiercely resolved not to lose self-control\neven for a moment, she forced herself to sit calm and motionless, to\ndrive back tears, to stifle sobs, groans, cries. And in time this\nresolutely simulated composure became very nearly genuine. Gradually she\nfound herself growing able to think rationally, not desperately. Thus\nthere was some chance for a practical idea--an inspiration--to evolve\nitself from out the rapid progression of her thoughts.\n\nShe was possessed of a quiet obstinacy that would not--that could\nnot--acknowledge final defeat so long as the most shadowy possibility of\nultimate success remained. The feeblest glimmer of hope was sufficient\nto support her courage, her energies. Now, although the end appeared to\nbe so near, although she was faced by obstacles that certainly looked\ninsurmountable, she could not bring herself to submit with meekness and\nresignation to what so surely seemed to be written in her fate.\n\nThus, still rebellious, she sat thinking, thinking. But no plan of\npossible action occurred to her mind. What could be done in two days\nto still a man's tongue, when prayers and entreaties and threats had\nall alike failed absolutely? The only method yet untried was that of\nbribery, and there she was a bankrupt. She had nothing to\noffer--absolutely no inducement to hold out.\n\nSlowly but surely the conviction forced itself upon her calmer\nreflection that she could indeed do no more; that she was hopelessly in\nMorris's power. She felt herself enveloped by a fresh access of despair.\nWhat a dire misfortune--what a fearsome calamity--that he should have\ncome upon the scene just at this crisis. He had declared almost with\ncertainty that had he found her already his cousin's wife he would have\nheld his peace. Why, oh why, had he not been kept out of her path for\ntwo short months longer--just until she was indeed safely married?\n\nSuddenly she started to her feet, her eyes glistening, her expression\neager and alert. At length a light shone in the dense gloom--in the\ntangled jungle a path had been found.\n\nAt this moment Philia was heard opening the street door. The old woman\nmade straight for the sitting-room, declaring as she came--\n\n\"Edie Gordon didn't know what pattern----\"\n\nThe words died on her lips as she beheld Evarne.\n\n\"My gosh, whatever made yer dress up pretty like that, to spend the\nevenin' alone?\" Then she added in a tone of sudden suspicion: \"Seems to\nme there's somethin' goin' on in this 'ere 'ouse what I don't know of!\nWhat 'ave I bin and done, to be kept in the dark about everythin' like\nthis for?\"\n\n\"You shan't be any longer, Philia. After your supper I'm going to tell\nyou everything.\"\n\n\"I'll buck up, then. 'A full stummick maketh a wise 'ead and a kind\n'eart'--Shakespeare.\"\n\nEre long she had finished her meal, and was ensconced in the arm-chair.\nEvarne drew up a footstool and sat down, resting against the old woman's\nknee. But she remained without speaking. Once or twice she half started\nupon her task, but the words died on her lips.\n\nPhilia at length broke the silence.\n\n\"Dearie, I'm almost old enough to be your grandmother, but for all that\nwe're jist real pals, ain't we? Remember, pals can always trust each\nother, and nothin' ever makes any real difference between 'em.\"\n\nThus encouraged, Evarne took the plunge and told the story of her life.\nWhen she had finished, she asked pleadingly--\n\n\"You don't mind? You're not very disappointed in me, are you, Philia? I\ndid care for him, really and truly I did.\"\n\nHer eyes were downcast, the tone of her voice was full of anxiety. The\nold woman's response took the form of a query.\n\n\"What do yer expect me to say to yer?\"\n\nEvarne shook her head somewhat hopelessly.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Can't yer look me straight in the face? I can't answer proper-like if\nyer won't.\"\n\nEvarne's mind was far too entirely taken up with deeper thoughts, with\nfuture schemes, for her to be really overweighed with embarrassment\nbefore Philia. Without any effort she raised her head instantly. The\nnecessity of an upturned face for an answer was then made clear. The old\nwoman bent forward and kissed her straight on the lips--a noisy,\nunabashed kiss.\n\n\"I might think badly of some gals, Evarne, but you--why, no matter who\nwas to tell me yer was a bad lot, I'd say 'Beggin' yer pardin', I knows\n'er too well! She's real good!'\"\n\nEvarne threw her arms impulsively around her old friend's neck, and\nmurmured her thanks.\n\n\"But listen,\" she continued, settling herself down again upon the\nfootstool. \"What I've told you is only the cause of my present trouble.\"\n\nBut almost in the same instant Philia had exclaimed--\n\n\"My gosh, what about Mr. Danvers?\"\n\n\"That's it--that's it! I haven't told him, and I never mean to, never,\nnever!\"\n\n\"And yer'd be a regular fool if yer did,\" declared this worldly-minded\ncounsellor.\n\n\"But--oh, it's too dreadful; it's too horrid!\"\n\n\"Hush, hush! Don't git excited.\"\n\nEvarne waited a minute, then went on quietly enough to relate the whole\nof her doubts and anxieties.\n\n\"At first I was in despair, as you may imagine,\" she concluded; \"but now\nI've got a fresh idea in my mind, and I want your help.\"\n\nPhilia rubbed her hands together with evident satisfaction. She had\nflung herself whole-heartedly on her pal's side in this affair.\n\n\"If we do succeed,\" went on Evarne, \"I shall owe all my happiness to\nyou, and so will Geoffrey, though he won't know it. I shall be grateful\nto you for ever and ever, and I shall look after you all your life,\nPhilia. Now, listen carefully. Morris said that if he had found me\nalready his cousin's wife--if our marriage had been an accomplished\nfact--then--very likely--he would of his own accord have remained silent\nforever concerning what he knows. He entirely repudiated the idea that\nhis determination to betray me is prompted by any spite or hatred. As it\nis, he has promised to hold his peace until Wednesday evening. Very\nwell, before that time I mean to be Geoffrey's wife.\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious to me, what a notion!\"\n\n\"It's absolutely my last resource. It's my one chance; my only hope. I\nshall persuade Geoff to take me abroad immediately, so that Morris\ncannot straightway tell him my secret in a sudden outburst of rage. If\nhe writes, I shall see that Geoff doesn't get the letter. Oh, I know\nit's leading me through vile deceitful tracks, but having started, I\nmust go on. But I wish I'd never started, Philia. That's Heaven's truth.\nI wish I'd never started! Ah, well! Besides--once I am Geoffrey's wife,\nthe keeping of this secret becomes a matter of life or death to me.\"\n\n\"But if the snake chose to tell after yer was safely married, 'e\ncouldn't do no 'arm then, could 'e?\"\n\n\"No harm? Oh, Philia! If Geoffrey once reproached me for entrapping\nhim--if I heard him regret his marriage--if he ever expressed half a\nwish that he could be free again, then, why then, there would be but one\ncourse open to me. I should kill myself.\"\n\nPhilia started.\n\n\"Don't talk of sich a thing,\" she almost wailed; \"don't plan it in cold\nblood like that. It's mad and wicked.\"\n\n\"Who says it's wicked?\"\n\n\"Why, everybody knows it is.\"\n\n\"'There's nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.' Did you\never hear that before? 'Everybody knows,' forsooth! Oh, Philia, how can\nyou be so blind! Surely it's perfectly obvious that it would be the one\nand only right course. As far as honour goes I should have no choice.\nDon't you believe it's necessarily wicked to kill one's self. Sometimes\nthe weak--the cowardly--the really despicable thing to do is to cling to\nlife. Oh, I'm beginning to hate myself--I'm being dragged through the\nmud and grimed almost beyond my own recognition. There, don't look at me\nlike that. But you mustn't think I'm so infamous as to be planning to\nuse Geoff's blind love--his noble, unquestioning trust in me--as the\nvery means by which to fetter him in bonds that would remain\nunbreakable, even though they might suddenly become repulsive to him. It\nis because power lies in these hands of mine--soft and slender though\nthey are--see them,\" and as she held them out and eyed them askance,\nthey shook like aspen leaves. \"It is because I can cut asunder all\nearthly ties between us, and set him free, that I dare expose him to the\nrisk. It's no use, Philia. I can't love in a sane, temperate, moderate\nsort of manner--I can't do it, I tell you! I love Geoff so much more\nthan myself--so infinitely much more--that life or death for me seems\nscarcely worth a thought.\"\n\nNo words came to the old woman; not even Shakespeare was able to suggest\nto her any comfort for this trembling girl, gliding so swiftly and\nsurely into deceit and sin.\n\n\"I needn't have told you of what I intend to do in the event of Morris's\nbetraying me after my marriage, though I shall tell him,\" Evarne went\non; \"but I--I--couldn't bear that you should misjudge me, dear. It would\nbe dreadful to me to think that you believed I was merely planning all\nthis from an unscrupulous desire to make my own position secure at all\ncosts.\"\n\n\"As if I'd think anything of the sort!\"\n\n\"Well, if you did, I for one couldn't blame you. I know it must look\nlike it. Oh, Philia, I'm miserable at what I'm doing,\" Evarne cried,\nknitting her white brow. \"If anyone had told me a week ago that I should\nsink to deliberate scheming to make Geoff marry me quickly, and that I\nwas seriously proposing to watch his correspondence, I should--there, I\nam mad, perhaps! I could almost wish to believe it. There is no truth,\nno honour in me! Oh, Philia, Philia, how I hope my dead father cannot\nsee what I am doing!\"\n\nShe shuddered, and buried her face convulsively in her friend's lap. The\nold woman, full of pity, passed her hand over the thick locks.\n\n\"Make up yer mind once and for all, my pet. Think about it well. Don't\ngo and do what yer will be sorry for.\"\n\nThe head was lifted immediately, defiantly.\n\n\"Oh, I know what I am going to do. I have done with thinking. I am going\nto marry Geoff.\"\n\n\"But 'ow are yer goin' to work the trick, so sudden like, without 'im\nwonderin' what's in yer mind?\"\n\n\"That's where you've got to help me. I don't see quite how to do it\nalone. With your aid it will be wickedly easy for me to--to deceive him,\nbecause he trusts me so entirely. Ah well! Now listen to my plan....\"\n\nTired of her low seat, she drew up a chair close to Philia.\n\nLong they sat into the night, arranging, discussing, even rehearsing\nwhat was to be done on the morrow. At length they separated, but slumber\nwas not for Evarne. No sooner had she laid her weary head upon the\npillow than there came to her from the distance the steady throb, throb\nof machinery.\n\n\"What can that be?\" she mused fretfully. \"There's no factory about here,\nand if there were, why should it be working in the middle of the night?\"\nShe rose up on her elbow to listen; the sound ceased. Once more she\nsought repose; the steady, distant beating recommenced. \"I couldn't\nsleep at the best of times through that persistent noise,\" she sighed.\n\nThen she seemed to hear cautious footsteps within her room. For a moment\nevery muscle of her body contracted with terror, and the thud of the\ndistant engines increased in volume tenfold. Starting up, she struck a\nmatch. The room was empty. As she lay down once more she realised the\nmeaning of all these strange, inexplicable sounds. Those steps, that\ndull, steady throbbing, all originated within her own tortured brain.\n\nRepeatedly through that night of wakefulness she could have believed she\nheard movements, even whispers, within the room. She lay on the\nborderland of slumber, against her will composing endless appeals to\nGeoff, begging for mercy, for forgiveness, for continued love, going\nover and over the pleas she might have uttered to Morris but had\nneglected.\n\n\"If I could sleep--oh, if I could only sleep!\" she cried wearily.\n\nBut the day broke without her having won oblivion for a single minute.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\n\n                        EVIL, THAT GOOD MAY COME\n\n\nThe morning dawned radiantly clear, and hot to sultriness. Evarne\ndressed leisurely, and by nine o'clock, far from being at the studio,\nwas still toying with her breakfast. Her magnificent health saved her\nfrom looking as exhausted as the sleepless night and the nerve-strain of\nthe last few days would well have justified. Indeed, with a hectic flush\nupon her cheek, and eyes supernaturally brilliant, any untrained\nobserver would have adjudged her a fit model for the goddess Hygeia\nherself.\n\n\"Do try and eat somethin',\" persuaded Philia anxiously. \"Goodness knows\nwhen you last 'ad a decent square meal.\"\n\n\"I don't feel that I can, and what's more, I can't stop looking at it\nany longer,\" declared the girl as she rose from the table. \"Those poor\nyoung men will be thinking I'm not coming again.\"\n\nAnd indeed at the studio everything did seem to be thoroughly\ndisorganised.\n\n\"Well, we have done a fine lot of work these last few days,\" remarked\nJack disconsolately.\n\nBut Pallister was in high spirits. He had seen Maudie Meridith on the\nprevious evening, and, moved by his earnest reproaches, she had\nundertaken to do her level best to come this very morning to give him a\nfirst sitting for her portrait. Thus he answered Jack's complaining\ngrowl with light-hearted _insouciance_.\n\n\"Oh, well, we can't all keep our noses eternally to the grindstone like\nyou do, old chap. I think we're getting along splendidly.\"\n\nBut Jack was not to be thus pacified.\n\n\"I don't want to waste this morning. Do you think Miss Stornway will be\ncoming, Geoff?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" rejoined that young man, turning from the open window from\nwhence he had been watching the passers-by in the street below. \"She\nwould have sent a message, as she did yesterday, if she still felt too\nunwell.\"\n\nAnd in a very few minutes his faith was justified; Evarne appeared at\nthe farther end of the street. He watched her as she drew near, noting\nhow she showed graceful and dignified amid the crowd. Although the\nstudio was on the third floor, the summer air was so clear that, as she\ndrew nearer, he could see her features quite distinctly. Some attraction\ndrew her gaze upwards, and she waved her hand in greeting, whereupon he\nran downstairs and met her at the garden gate.\n\nHer dress fitted exquisitely over her lovely figure; it was of pink\ncambric, made according to her individual fancy in costume. Its rich hue\nemphasised her dark eyes and flawless complexion as none other could\nhave done, while her simple straw hat was wreathed with blush roses.\nGeoff had never yet beheld her clad from head to foot in shades of pink,\nand thus arrayed, apart from all question of personal affection, she\nmust have been a sheer delight to any artist's eye.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm dreadfully late,\" she said apologetically to Jack and\nPallister on gaining the studio. \"Please forgive me, and you shall just\nsee how quickly I can get into those Greek robes when I like.\"\n\n\"You must sit down first and have a rest after your walk,\" insisted\nGeoff, while Pallister declared gaily--\n\n\"Don't trouble about me. You're going to have a rival this morning.\"\n\n\"A rival! This is very serious.\"\n\n\"Such a pretty one too.\"\n\n\"Really? Who is she?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! You'll see when she comes.\"\n\nHe jumped down from the studio flight of steps on which he had been\nperched, skipped gaily across the floor, and leant perilously far out of\nthe low window.\n\n\"How excited that baby is,\" said Geoff, smiling indulgently. \"He expects\nMiss Meridith to give him a sitting to-day. Now, come here, sit down by\nme and rest. Could you eat some of those cherries?\"\n\nEvarne consented to try, and took her seat on the divan beside Geoff,\nthe plate on her lap. Pallister glanced at the little group.\n\n\"I say, Jack,\" declared the wise youth, \"guess we're not exactly\nindispensable to the consumption of those cherries. Come down to the\ngarden and let's have a smoke till Maudie arrives.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of sketching Geoff and Miss Stornway as they sat\ntogether there,\" said Jack simply. But since Pallister received this\nproposition with a hearty burst of laughter, he meekly wended his way\ndownstairs, still complaining under his breath at the valuable hours he\nwas losing.\n\n\"You're sure you feel quite well again?\" demanded Geoff for about the\nfifth time, reading Evarne's face with an anxious, not over-satisfied\nglance. \"You don't look quite the same as usual somehow, sweetest.\"\n\n\"You're fanciful,\" and the bright eyes were flashed upon him\nreassuringly. \"I'm quite well and strong, and ready to face the world.\"\n\n\"That's good hearing. You'd laugh at me if you knew how I've been\nworrying about you. I vow I lay awake half the night thinking of you.\"\n\n\"Don't be so proud about it, for I did exactly the same thing for you.\nAt least, to be exact, I sat up talking to old Philia about Geoff and\nall his faults and virtues. She really is a good old soul, and has taken\nquite a fancy to you.\"\n\n\"And since it seems that her presence in your little home is essential\nto my being allowed there, I have, perforce, taken quite a liking to\nher. Good thing it's a mutual affection, eh?\"\n\n\"Isn't it indeed? Well, to-night sees the end of her sittings, so you\nwill be able to come quite often if you care to. To start with, I\nherewith formally invite you to supper to-morrow night. Miss Evarne\nStornway requests the pleasure of Mr. Geoffrey Danvers' company at\nsupper to-morrow night, at seven-thirty. R.S.V.P.\"\n\n\"Mr. Danvers has much pleasure in accepting Miss Stornway's kind\ninvitation for Tuesday evening,\" returned Geoff with mock solemnity.\n\n\"Right!\" laughed Evarne, clapping her hands together gleefully. \"You\nshall come out into the kitchen and help me make pancakes. I'm really\nquite adorable then. You will just love me when you see me making\npancakes.\"\n\nShe tossed back her head and dangled a cherry into her open mouth.\nGeoff's reply was interrupted by the sound of stumbling footsteps\nmounting the stairs.\n\n\"Talking of angels,\" cried Evarne, as a panting figure leaned against\nthe doorway. \"Why, Philia, what do you want?\"\n\n\"H'excuse my intrudin',\" commenced the old woman. \"Two young gentlemen\nsittin' in the garden told me to come right up, and I should find the\nstudio at the top of the stairs, and the door standin' open. I couldn't\nlose me way if I tried, they said; and sure enough I'm 'ere.\"\n\n\"Then come in and sit down, Mrs. Harbert,\" said Geoff. \"I hope nothing's\nthe matter?\"\n\n\"I'm quite well, thankin' you, sir, and the same to you. I wanted to\nconsult Evarne on a matter of great himportance. I've got to decide in a\n'urry, or I wouldn't 'ave hintruded.\"\n\n\"Well, here is Evarne. I'll leave you for a while.\"\n\n\"Don't go, Geoff,\" said the girl, laying her hand on his arm. \"I don't\nsuppose it's any great and wondrous secret, is it, Philia?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. Jist after you'd gorn comes a letter for me from that\nvery nice gentleman, Mr. Topham--the same as I sat for six months ago as\nthe Countess o' Suffolk, saying as 'ow she wouldn't 'ave 'er 'ead cut\noff.\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"Well, now--well. What do you think? You'd never guess! 'E wants me to\ngo to Scotland for two 'ole months to pose for 'im out of doors all\namong the gorse and 'eather and 'eath! It's a bit o' kindness on Mr.\nTopham's part, for I s'pose there's elderly ladies in Scotland 'e could\npaint, but 'e allus was good to me. I'm to telegraph me answer and go on\nThursday mornin'. I'd like to go ever so much--wouldn't I jist, my\ngosh!--but I'm worryin' about 'ow you'd git on without me, Evarne.\"\n\n\"Oh, you ought not to miss such a splendid offer. Let me see the letter,\nmay I?\"\n\nAfter glancing through its contents the girl handed it back.\n\n\"She really ought to go, Geoff, oughtn't she? Mr. Topham offers very\ngenerous terms, including the fare both ways. She needs a change. Don't\nyou, Philia? It will be splendid for you to get out of London this hot\nweather. I only wish a holiday could be managed for poor little Evarne.\nYes, I decide for you--you must accept.\"\n\n\"That's all very fine for me,\" demurred the old woman; \"but what about\nyou, left all alone in the 'ouse?\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!\" demanded Geoff. \"What will you do?\"\n\n\"That's jist what I was wonderin' as I came along 'ere,\" declared\nPhilia. \"Comin' 'ome tired as she does, 'ardly able to stand\nsometimes--pore child--and not a soul there to say a word to 'er, or git\n'er so much as a cup o' tea! I'm afraid I ought to tell Mr. Topham as\n'ow I can't come.\"\n\nEvarne did not answer for a few seconds.\n\n\"It does sound a touching picture, certainly. You make me quite sorry\nfor myself,\" she confessed. Then with a sudden forced renewal of\nbrightness: \"But there, it can't be helped. Any number of models live\nalone always. Of course Philia must go to Scotland, and I mustn't be\nselfish and lazy.\"\n\n\"It ain't a question of bein' jist selfish and lazy,\" rejoined the old\nwoman rather testily. \"I ain't sure it would be right of me to go\ngallawantin' jist now. 'Twould be different if yer was quite well and\nstrong. But I ask yer to answer honest. Ain't this 'ot weather upsettin'\nyer? Ain't yer bein' overworked or somethin'? She 'arf fainted again\nlast night, sir. She ain't so strong by 'alf as she likes to make out. I\ndidn't ought to go, I knows it, though I do want to.\"\n\n\"Evarne, you told me you felt better,\" cried Geoff in mingled reproach\nand alarm.\n\n\"So I am this morning,\" she rejoined, smiling at him. \"Now, you run off\nhome, Philia, and think about packing.\"\n\nBut the old woman shook her head, lingered and looked at Geoff with eyes\nfull of doubt and anxiety.\n\n\"Do you think I ought to leave 'er lonely, sir?\"\n\nHe was decidedly uneasy at the idea.\n\n\"I don't like the notion--really I don't. Look here, can't you get a\nservant?\"\n\nEvarne smiled again, this time somewhat ruefully.\n\n\"He does think we're rich, doesn't he, Philia? Dear Geoff, to speak\nfrankly, I can't afford it.\"\n\nHe put his hand on her arm.\n\n\"Darling, surely you will let me see to that for you?\"\n\nShe shook her head with unhesitating decision.\n\n\"I couldn't possibly let you ever give me money.\"\n\nAt length Philia saw an opening, and no alert lawyer could have darted\nat it more promptly.\n\n\"Until 'e is yer 'usband, yer mean. Then he'll 'ave a right to, won't\n'e?\"\n\n\"Of course, everything will be different then,\" she assented, with a\nswift, shy glance at her lover.\n\n\"But, you dear little silly,\" he rejoined tenderly, \"it's only a\nquestion of two or three weeks at the very outside. What real difference\ncan it possibly make?\"\n\n\"It does--I feel it does. Please don't press the point. Now, Geoff,\nremember I'm always right. You owned that yesterday evening.\"\n\n\"Yes, and what did I tell you? Have you forgotten? That you would have\nto marry me all the sooner on account of this terrible correctness. Now,\nthen, how much sooner does this fresh example bring it?\"\n\nHere Mrs. Harbert chipped in again, desperately seizing the bull by the\nhorns.\n\n\"It's a real pity yer 'aven't bin engaged a week or two longer, both of\nyer. Then I'd say, git married at once--to-morrow--to-day, and let\nEvarne 'ave a 'usband to look after 'er 'enceforward.\"\n\nGeoff's eyes brightened.\n\n\"I say----\" he was commencing, but Evarne interrupted in tones of\nobvious annoyance.\n\n\"You ought not to say things like that, Philia. It's very\ninconsiderate.\"\n\nBut the culprit was in no ways disconcerted.\n\n\"Lor, she's a regular babby,\" she declared laughing. \"The very idea o'\nreally gettin' spliced makes 'er that bashful.\"\n\nAnd sure enough the colour on Evarne's cheeks had perceptibly deepened.\n\n\"Jist look if she ain't gorn as red as a radish,\" continued Mrs.\nHarbert. \"And all along o' the idea of a weddin'!\"\n\n\"It's not that,\" declared Evarne with energy; \"it was your silly\nsuggestion of getting married at once--without any delay--that vexed me.\nYou oughtn't to say things of that sort. You're excited about this\nScotch tour, you stupid old Philia. As if people ever rushed off and got\nmarried at twenty-four hours' notice! And for no better reason than that\nI run the risk of feeling lonely and unhappy in an empty house. Bless\nthe darling, she shan't have any of the hardships of life--no, she\nshan't! You've got no right to mortify me so; it's horrid of you, I'm\nreally vexed with you.\"\n\nShe moved away, and sat down with her back to Philia, tapping the floor\nangrily with the tip of her pretty pink shoe. The old woman shrugged her\nshoulders and appealed to Geoff in decidedly nettled tones.\n\n\"Mr. Danvers, sir, am I a fool or is she? One of us is, that's certain,\nand though I asks yer which it is, I knows without bein' told. Maybe I\n'ave taken liberties. I was only jokin'. Still, it's unkind o' Evarne to\ntalk to me like that, ain't it? I'd better make up me mind not to go\naway, and 'ave done with all talk. 'Lonely and un'appy!' Why, it might\nbe the death of 'er--that's what it might be. Yes, my beauty, you've\nchucked yerself downstairs in a faint once in yer life. You'll be doin'\nit again.\"\n\nEvarne glanced over her shoulder.\n\n\"Rubbish! I was ill then.\"\n\n\"So yer are now; what's the good o' denyin' it? You'll take a header\nover the banisters one fine evenin' and cut yer 'ead open on the floor,\nand it will bleed and bleed and bleed, and no one will know. You'll lie\nthere all night, and in the mornin' you'll be dead--a corpse--d'you\nhear?--cold and stiff--and all the howlin' in the world won't make yer\nalive agin.\"\n\nEvarne laughed at this lurid visionary tableau, and recovered her\ntemper.\n\n\"Why, what a very vivid imagination----\" she was commencing.\n\nBut Geoff interrupted. He had been rapidly turning over in his mind this\nstartling idea of an immediate wedding, and found it rose-. Not\nonly did he long for the day that should give him the woman he loved,\nbut he foresaw that, by his marriage being once put beyond the pale of\nargument, he would probably avoid a great deal of useless discussion and\nconsequent ill-feeling between himself and his cousin. Except\nWinborough, he had no relations sufficiently near to feel themselves\naggrieved at not having been confided in about the matter--and indeed\nwhen were aunts or cousins ever seriously considered in such a case? The\none objection to this unconventional suddenness was that it might be\nmore pleasant for Evarne not to have had her wedding in any way\napparently hurried or peculiar. But now other circumstances seemed to\ncounter-balance this really very small and indefinite objection.\n\nThus his meditations were not long protracted, and he interrupted\nEvarne's sentence upon sudden impulse.\n\n\"Mrs. Harbert is quite right. It would not be at all safe for you to be\nliving absolutely alone while you're liable to these horrible fainting\nattacks. Dearest--dearest--marry me to-morrow and give me the right to\nreally look after you and care for you. Please don't shake your head.\nObviously it is in every way best and advisable. Why do you hesitate? We\ndon't want a smart wedding or anything alarming of that sort, do we? You\ndo care for me, really and truly, don't you, and you believe that you\nwill be safe and happy with me? Mrs. Harbert, you've had a really\nbrilliant idea----\"\n\n\"Lor, sir, I only spoke in fun. I never thought of your takin' it\nserious-like.\"\n\n\"But you see now, don't you--don't you, Evarne--that to procure a\nspecial licence and get married to-morrow morning, without any\nunnecessary preparation, will save a world of annoyance and anxiety? My\ndear one, do think how I should worry about you. Besides--besides--the\ntruth is, I want to feel that you are mine beyond the possibility of\nyour changing your mind.\"\n\n\"You think I might, then?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't mean that exactly. There, I don't want to have to think\nabout it at all; I want to make our marriage a fact. I want to be secure\nof you. Our circumstances are somewhat peculiar. We have neither of us\ngot any relations we need to think of; we've only got each other in the\nwhole world, Evarne. Why should we run any risks? Dear one, dear love,\nbe persuaded. Say 'yes,' and you shall never, never regret it.\"\n\nHe spoke in tones soft and coaxing enough to melt a heart of stone, yet\nhe received no answer, either by word or look. Somewhat puzzled, Philia\nbroke the protracted silence.\n\n\"Yer can't love 'im as much as yer told me, or you'd be 'appy at the\nidea of callin' 'im 'usband.\"\n\nBut Evarne heeded her not. She was overwhelmed with shame at the ease\nwith which her own plot had succeeded. Where she was concerned, Geoff\nwas absolutely devoid of the faintest suspicions of any description. The\nbare possibility of trickery, of prearrangement or of falsehood having\nany part in Philia's unexpected visit to the studio, obviously never\nentered his mind. It was enough to him to be made to see that his 'Sweet\nLady's' material well-being would be benefited by her becoming his wife\nat once, and immediately his whole desire was to persuade her to this\ncourse of action. Knowing that practically every word she had spoken\nthat morning had been uttered with the full intention of deceiving--as\npart of a deliberate scheme--the perfect confidence he had in her\nintegrity and honour, his loyal, generous, and complete trust, were to\nher a bitter reproach. It stabbed her conscience, and she stood silent\nand abashed before him.\n\nBut far was it from her thoughts to waver in her purpose at this\neleventh hour. Raising her head, she looked for a minute full into\nGeoff's earnest grey eyes, and within her heart she again registered a\nvow to put his happiness, his welfare, first and foremost now and in the\nfuture. These minutes of apparent hesitation were sacred, and her\nexpression was intense and solemn as she replied in a slightly quivering\nvoice--\n\n\"My own beloved, I am yours, absolutely and without restriction. You are\nto decide my life, my actions; to guide my very thoughts as is most\npleasing to you. Everything shall be done exactly as you desire.\"\n\nEntirely oblivious of Mrs. Harbert's presence he thanked her by kisses.\n\n\"I'll telegraph to Mr. Topham, then,\" interposed the overlooked Philia\nafter a minute. \"I'll tell 'im I'm comin' right enough. Now, 'owever\nwill I find out what train to git or what station to go from, or\nanything else?\"\n\nEvarne came back to earth.\n\n\"Ask Geoff to look it up in the time-table for you,\" she suggested.\n\n\"Certainly. Where is it you want to go to?\"\n\n\"Saint--Saint--it's Saint somewhere,\" and Philia again peered into her\nletter. \"St. Andrews.\"\n\nAs the young man left the studio to find the time-table, she came close\nto Evarne, a broad smile of triumph on her genial countenance.\n\n\"Well, now, ain't I bin and gorn and done well? Ain't I a fine hactress?\nDidn't the stage lose a shinin' light when I took up Hart as a\nprofession? Ain't I got a fine invention too? Didn't I ought to 'ave\nwritten books? Ain't I been wonderful sharp? Pity I ain't a beastly\nlawyer.\"\n\nEvarne seized both the old woman's hands in a somewhat frantic grip.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, I shall never forget what you've done for me. I'm saved.\nThank God--thank God!\"\n\n\"Keep quiet, duckie. It's not quite done yet. You've got to prevent 'im\nfrom tellin' the snake till after it's over.\"\n\n\"I know, but Heaven is on my side.\"\n\nIn a few moments Geoff returned with a slip of paper in his hand.\n\n\"See here, I've written down times and station, so you'll have no\ndifficulty. We must go away for a honeymoon, mustn't we, Evarne?\"\n\n\"Of course. I shouldn't feel that I'd been legally married without\nthat,\" she declared promptly and gladly.\n\n\"You'll help her pack, then, and look after her generally, won't you,\nMrs. Harbert? Do you know of anything she wants? If so, tell me.\"\n\n\"There's nothin' as I knows of as won't wait until Thursday, when yer\ncan git it for 'er yerself,\" declared Philia.\n\n\"Please don't talk about me as if I wasn't present,\" remonstrated\nEvarne. \"You run away now, Philia. By the way, Geoff, you must come to\nsupper with me to-night. It will be the last real opportunity I shall\nhave of playing genuine hostess to you. Think of that!\"\n\nHe naturally agreed, whereupon Evarne and Philia indulged in a brief\nwhispered debate concerning the _menu_ for the evening meal. At length\nthe old dame took her departure, thoroughly well satisfied with her own\nhitherto unsuspected cleverness.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER XL\n\n                          A FRESH COMPLICATION\n\n\nImmediately they were alone Geoff seized Evarne by both hands, and\nholding her at arm's length, surveyed her from head to foot, as if for\nthe first time.\n\n\"Evarne, Evarne! to think that by to-morrow evening you will be my wife!\nCan you realise it? I hardly can.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to try,\" she asserted. \"It doesn't do to make too certain\nof anything in this world. Perhaps we shan't be able to get a special\nlicence.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's quite simple. A friend of mine was married by that means. We\nhave to make solemn affidavits that there is no legal impediment. Then\nit is essential that the ceremony shall take place in the parish where\none of us has lived for a certain length of time. You won't mind being\nmarried in church?\"\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"Besides getting the licence, then, all we have to do is to arrange with\na clergyman, and there need not be an hour's delay. It's not even\nnecessary to heed the canonical hours. I'd better go down to Doctors\nCommons almost immediately and see about it.\"\n\nJust then a girl's bright laugh fell upon their ears, footsteps were\nheard mounting the stairs, and in a minute Maudie Meridith, Jack and\nPallister entered the studio. The little lady, though somewhat\nbreathless, was in high spirits. She evidently looked upon this visit\nquite in the light of an adventure.\n\n\"Only fancy my getting here safe and sound, Mr. Danvers!\" she exclaimed\nin her gay voice. \"It's just like a novelette, isn't it?\"\n\nPallister speedily introduced the two young women to one another.\nAlthough it was tacitly recognised that Geoff's engagement was not to be\nmade public knowledge just yet, Pallister had not been able to resist\nthe temptation of relating to Maudie the events that had arisen from\nWinborough's visit to the studio on Monday afternoon. She therefore\ngazed with the keenest interest upon the beautiful model who was one day\nto become a countess, and greeted her with the utmost cordiality and\nsweetness.\n\n\"Did you find it awfully difficult to escape by yourself?\" inquired\nPallister, stumbling over the stand of his easel as he rushed about\nmaking final preparations.\n\n\"It was fairly simple. I was so frightened at breakfast, for auntie\nsuddenly announced she was going out somewhere or other--anyhow, she\nsuggested that I should go with her. I was dreadfully upset, for I\ncouldn't think of any reasonable excuse for refusing.\"\n\n\"But an idea came at last?\"\n\n\"Fortunately there was no need. Auntie, who was opening her letters,\ncame to one from Madame Constantia, her dressmaker, saying she should\ncall this morning. So I was able to slip away easily--lucky, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Rather! Now let's pose you for this wondrous picture.\"\n\nAfter many different attempts, he turned to his friends with a satisfied\nair: \"I think that's perfect. What do you say, you others?\"\n\nPublic opinion decided that the model's left arm had better be placed\nnegligently over the arm of the chair.\n\n\"Ah, that's a great improvement,\" confessed the artist.\n\n\"It can't possibly be altered for the better, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"How am I to pose my eyes?\" inquired the docile model.\n\n\"That doesn't matter at present. Now, keep quite still.\"\n\nHolding a stick of charcoal at arm's-length, Pallister unconsciously put\non a stern and impressive frown as he commenced to put leading lines\nupon his big new canvas.\n\nGeoff and Evarne once again sat down side by side on the divan, and in\nlow tones proceeded to discuss the prosaic business arrangements for the\neventful morrow. Evarne did not disguise her anxiety to leave England\nimmediately on the completion of the wedding ceremony, and thus Geoff\nhad now to make arrangements for the journey, find out times of trains\nand boats, take tickets and telegraph to hotels, as well as procure the\nlicence and arrange with a clergyman.\n\nThe discussion of the many details that had to be considered occupied\nsome time, and at length the silence of the room, broken only by the\nindistinct murmurs of this inaudible conversation, became boring in the\nextreme to Miss Maudie.\n\n\"I wish I could see you working as I sit, Frankie; but of course that\nisn't possible,\" she said somewhat plaintively.\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" agreed Pallister. \"But you must have plenty of rests,\nand then you can see how I'm getting on, though you know it's never very\npleasant to show work in its early stages to any but a fellow-artist.\"\n\n\"But won't you do better than ever, knowing that I'm going to look at\nit? Am I not an inspiration?\"\n\n\"Of course you are, but you'll see yourself looking like a nightmare,\nwith black eyes and yellow cheeks and so on. But don't worry about that.\nIt's only at first. I feel that in the end I'm going to make this a\nveritable masterpiece.\"\n\nAfter a very few more minutes' silence she spoke again.\n\n\"What fun this is! I'm not really tired yet, and I've been sitting a\nlong time already, haven't I?\"\n\n\"Oh Maudie, hardly that.\"\n\n\"What, haven't I? Dear me, I thought I had.\"\n\n\"Don't wriggle your head, there's an angel.\"\n\n\"Was I wriggling?\" inquired the victim. \"I'm so sorry; my neck felt\nstiff.\"\n\n\"You must have a rest, then.\"\n\n\"Oh no, thank you. It doesn't matter. I can bear it.\"\n\nBut the tones of resignation were too touching. Pallister laid down his\nbrushes.\n\n\"Come along. Don't let yourself get thoroughly tired, or you'll not want\nto come again. Besides, models sometimes faint if they have to go on\nposing after they are tired out. You ask Miss Stornway if you don't\nbelieve me.\"\n\nEvarne corroborated Pallister's assertion, though in her heart she did\nnot think there was much danger of Maudie collapsing yet awhile.\nNevertheless the girl gladly descended from the throne, and almost\ninstantly her glance fell upon the diamond ring sparkling upon Evarne's\nhand.\n\nThere seems something particularly attractive to \"Sweet Seventeen\" about\nengagement rings.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Stornway,\" she cried, \"do let me look at your ring. What a\nperfect beauty!\"\n\nEvarne was pleased by this admiration.\n\n\"You ought to see it in the sunshine,\" she declared. \"It is too lovely\nfor words then.\"\n\nShe rose from the divan, and crossed over towards the window. Standing\nin the full flood of golden August sunlight, she held out her hand for\nMaudie's continued inspection. For a time she too revelled in the\nrainbow-hued scintillations of the diamonds, but after a few moments her\nglance strayed casually down the street. Immediately she broke in upon\nthe girl's rapturous comments with a strangled little cry of mingled\ndismay and surprise.\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded Geoff, rising quickly to his feet.\n\nMaudie gazed wonderingly out of the window. Suddenly she too uttered an\nexclamation, then drew sharply back behind the curtains as she announced\nin excited tones--\n\n\"Why, there's Lord Winborough coming down the road. He's making straight\nfor here. I know he's coming up. Oh, my word, now what shall I do?\"\n\nJack was on the alert in a moment.\n\n\"Lord Winborough coming here?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Whatever am I to do?\"\n\n\"Why should you do anything? Does it matter?\" queried Jack, considerably\npuzzled.\n\n\"Matter!\" retorted the girl somewhat tartly. \"Of course it does. He\nknows my father quite well, and he would be sure to tell him he had met\nme here. Oh, I shall get into dad's black books, and so will auntie.\nWhat can I do?\"\n\n\"Ask him not to say anything about it,\" suggested Jack promptly.\n\nMaudie waxed impatient.\n\n\"One can't do that sort of thing. It would only make it seem worse.\nCan't I hide somewhere? Frankie, I do think you might have told me he\nwas coming.\"\n\n\"But he wasn't expected till this afternoon. You can't blame me,\"\ndeclared Pallister in expostulation.\n\nIn the midst of this fluster Evarne stood for a minute as if stunned.\nHere was an entirely unforeseen _contretemps_ to be dealt with. Quite\nheedless of Maudie's infinitesimal troubles, she bent all her thoughts\non safeguarding her own situation. What would be the result of this\nvisit? Morris would most assuredly hold himself released from his\npromise of forty-eight hours' silence if he learnt from Geoff that the\nforbidden marriage was to be actually celebrated within that time. Did\nGeoff intend taking his cousin into his confidence? She must know that.\nConcealing every sign of undue anxiety she whispered--\n\n\"Are we going to tell him about to-morrow?\"\n\nShe breathed a sigh of relief at the answer.\n\n\"Not unless it becomes inevitable.\"\n\n\"Isn't there another way out, Mr. Danvers?\" cried the distracted Maudie.\n\nGeoff came to the rescue.\n\n\"Why not take Miss Meridith out by the back entrance, Pallister? You\nknow--out into Langthorne Place.\"\n\n\"He mustn't come with me,\" declared the girl emphatically. \"I mustn't\nhave any of you with me. Somebody would be certain to see us. People one\nknows always are about when one doesn't want them to be.\"\n\n\"But you can go this way by yourself if you like,\" said Geoff; and\ngetting the necessary key, he hastened down the little passage between\nthe plaster-room and the model's dressing-room, and unlocked and\nunbolted the door at the end. Then returning he explained--\n\n\"Go down those stairs, and you'll find yourself in a corridor. Turn to\nthe left and go straight ahead; take the second turning on the left\nagain, and on the right you'll see another flight of stairs. That is the\nLangthorne Place entrance to this block of flats. When you get into the\nstreet, turn to the right, and then the first to the right again brings\nyou----\"\n\nMaudie interposed plaintively.\n\n\"I forget already what you said first. I'm sure to get lost.\"\n\nAt this moment the electric bell rang out.\n\n\"Shall I come with you, and put you safely into a taxi?\" suggested\nEvarne suddenly.\n\nThis offer was accepted with alacrity.\n\n\"Oh, that is kind of you, Miss Stornway. You must think I'm a silly\nlittle baby, but----\"\n\nEvarne did not listen. She picked up her hat.\n\n\"I wish he had not come,\" she said softly to Geoff as she inserted\nhatpins. \"Don't let him talk about me, will you, or you may quarrel, and\nI should be so worried about that?\"\n\nHere the bell rang out again--a long insistent strain. Evarne stepped\nhurriedly with Maudie into the little corridor, closing the studio door\nafter her. Geoff waited a minute or two to allow them time to get clear\naway, then admitted his cousin.\n\nThe course Evarne had thus adopted was indeed prompted by cowardice, but\nit was also upheld by policy. At the sound of Winborough's first ring, a\nterrible shudder of repulsion had thrilled through her every nerve. The\nnecessity of again beholding that man who stood without seemed\nabsolutely overwhelming. She clenched her hands violently at the\nremembrance of his brutal and gratuitous insults of the previous\nevening. Had she the strength, the fortitude to meet him once more and\nremain impassive? She mistrusted herself. Ah, if she only dared flee\nbefore him as Maudie was doing.\n\nAnd from this desire had sprung the thought that she would probably\nreally safeguard her own cause by being absent at this moment--that her\npresence in the studio, far from being necessary, would be a decided\nadditional menace to her safety. At the present moment Morris was under\na pledge of silence concerning her; Geoff, too, had a secret he was not\nanxious to divulge. Unless provoked by some exterior event, it was more\nthan probable that her name would be deliberately avoided by both men.\nMoreover, the presence of Jack and Pallister would further suffice to\nprevent the cousins willingly introducing a subject that was likely to\nlead to contention.\n\nBut were she actually in the room with them, who could tell what might\nnot result from so painful and awkward a situation? A hundred unforeseen\ncomplications might easily ensue, leading to defiance, loss of\nself-control, disregard of promises, betrayal! No, this precious chance\nso innocently offered her by Maudie of getting out of the place for a\ntime was not to be neglected.\n\nYet no sooner had she taken the decisive step than she half regretted\nher choice. After all, there had been but scant time for consideration.\nWas she indeed acting wisely? Sudden suspicion clamoured loudly. Was\nMorris's promise to be relied on? Why had he come that morning? She\nhesitated, and stood still. A cold fear seized her, causing her heart to\nthrob still more painfully. Then, regardless of what her companion might\nthink, she very softly turned the handle of the studio door, pushed it\nan inch or two ajar, and stood listening.\n\nWinborough was apparently in an amiable frame of mind. He greeted the\nthree young men with the utmost friendliness, and after a few desultory\nremarks concerning the weather, proceeded to explain the reason of his\nunexpected arrival.\n\n\"It is not convenient for me to spare any time this afternoon, Mr.\nHardy. I should prefer that you perform your operations upon me\nimmediately, if possible.\"\n\nJack remained speechless, quite disconcerted by this unexpected demand.\n\n\"The life-mask?\" queried Pallister.\n\n\"Yes. What do you say, Geoffrey?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Just as you choose. Jack has got all the materials ready and\nwaiting for this afternoon, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, indeed I have. I can do it just as well at once,\" assented that\nyoung man, finding his tongue.\n\nEvarne waited to hear no more. It was with the most cordial\nthanksgivings that she listened to the very simple explanation of this\nvisit that a moment ago had seemed so sinister. She sped before the\nsound of Jack's approaching footsteps, locking the outer door very\ngently with the key that Geoff had left in the lock.\n\nThe wondering and decidedly shocked Maudie was waiting patiently\noutside. Concealing the sick anxiety that she must feel so long as those\ntwo men were together, Evarne said cheerily--\n\n\"Just fancy, Lord Winborough is going to have his life-mask taken\nimmediately. Mr. Pallister will be interested. He is so clever at\nmodelling, isn't he? I should think he would be very successful some\nday.\"\n\nMaudie swallowed the bait, and forbearing to ask awkward questions,\ncommenced to chatter brightly about Frankie's marvellous talents.\n\nThus they wended their way downstairs, and gained the street.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XLI\n\n                  HOW \"LA BELLE DAME\" LED JACK ASTRAY\n\n\nJack set to work with somewhat feverish ardour to collect the necessary\nmaterials for his task. In a minute or two Pallister entered the little\nroom.\n\n\"Can I help in any way?\" he inquired.\n\nJack glanced up.\n\n\"Yes. You might go and get one of my clean painting-blouses from the\nbox, and give it to Lord Winborough. He must put it on, or he will get\nsmothered with this messy stuff.\"\n\nPallister obeyed. Shaking out the laundress's folds, he laid the clean\ngarment insinuatingly over a chair. Then noticing that Winborough was\nstanding surveying the charcoal outline of Maudie, he whistled softly to\nhimself, made a grimace, and skipped rapidly back to the safety of the\nplaster-room. For the nonce Geoff and his cousin were left alone.\n\nOft-times who can tell precisely how it was, or why or whence a quarrel\nsprang to life? Geoff was resolved not to mention Evarne; Winborough was\npractically bound by honour to the same course. Yet certain it is that\nthis one subject--religiously tabooed, yet all the time uppermost in\nboth minds--somehow came to the front. Then a word taken amiss, a tone\nof the voice, a glance of the eye, and hot anger sapped the resolutions\nof cooler moments. In the main, both cousins held firm to their original\ndeterminations. Geoff made no mention of the imminence of his marriage;\nWinborough guarded his fatal secret loyally. But despite this, their\nvoices, raised loud in wrath, penetrated to the ears of Jack and\nPallister in the plaster-room.\n\n\"Good gracious, what's up?\" queried Pallister, with a startled\nexpression. \"Do you suppose Lord Winborough has found out that Maudie\nhas been here?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Can't you guess? I'll bet anything you like they're\nquarrelling over Geoff's engagement.\"\n\n\"They jolly well are quarrelling, aren't they?\"\n\n\"I should just think so. I wonder what we had better do.\"\n\n\"Is everything ready? How very awkward. We can hardly intrude in the\nmiddle of a family debate, can we?\"\n\nThey remained in doubt, listening with growing concern to the storm that\nwas raging in the next room. In a few minutes the question of the course\nthey were to take was settled for them. The door of the studio opening\non to the little corridor was flung wide, and Winborough's voice was\nheard calling in curt, imperative tones--\n\n\"Mr. Hardy! Mr. Hardy!\"\n\nWith a bound Jack appeared at the door of the plaster-room. Winborough's\nface was flushed with anger, his words were brief and final.\n\n\"Possibly I may write to you about this bust. I'll consider the matter.\nGood-day.\"\n\nWaiting for no response, he turned and strode across the studio to the\nother door. There he spun round suddenly on his heel and flung a final\nthreat at Geoff.\n\n\"As to you--well--you'll be convinced of your folly very shortly. On\nThursday morning you will receive a packet of papers from my lawyer that\nmay serve to bring you to your senses. After that, I wash my hands of\nyou.\"\n\nSo saying, he left the room, and in another moment the front door had\nbanged behind him.\n\n\"What's up,\" inquired Pallister with assumed innocence, entering the\nstudio. \"Where's his lordship gone to, running off just when we are\nready for him?\"\n\nGeoff made no answer. He sat moodily by the table, his chin resting upon\nhis clenched hand. He murmured a few words beneath his breath, but\nbestowed not the least attention upon his two companions.\n\nJack spoke despondently.\n\n\"I'm afraid Lord Winborough isn't going to let me do that bust after\nall. Didn't you hear what he said? That possibly he would write to me.\nOnly 'possibly.' I know those 'possiblies.'\"\n\nPallister's countenance assumed an expression of incredulous disgust.\n\n\"Oh, I say--lost our lord! What's the matter with him?\"\n\nJack remained silent, unable to answer his query. Geoff pulled himself\ntogether.\n\n\"It can't be helped,\" he said briefly. \"Winborough and I have been\nexpressing our candid opinion of one another, and one of the results is,\nas Jack surmises, that the sittings for the bust are indefinitely\npostponed. Where is Evarne? Hasn't she returned yet?\"\n\n\"No, I expect she went a little way with Maudie.\"\n\n\"I'm glad she didn't see that brute,\" announced Geoff, going to the\nwindow and looking frowningly after the motorcar that was bearing his\ncousin swiftly down the road.\n\n\"What a fine old row,\" murmured Pallister. Then keen regret for the\nabandoned life-mask swept across his mind, and he cried impulsively:\n\"Oh, I say, though! What a beastly disappointment it all is. Don't you\nthink you're a jolly nuisance, Geoff, spoiling all our arrangements so\ncalmly?\"\n\nGeoff turned sharply round at this piece of impertinence, but ere the\nangry retort had passed his lips, his eye fell upon Jack, who was\nsitting silently apart, both his attitude and expression betraying the\nuttermost dejection. Geoff crossed over and stood before his friend.\n\n\"I am sorry, Jack,\" he said simply.\n\n\"Don't trouble about me,\" was the somewhat sullen answer. \"Luck is\nalways against me--always has been--always will be, I suppose. He won't\nwrite. He was only doing it to oblige you. Of course I knew that well\nenough. Now I shall stick in the mud forever, I suppose. I never seem to\nget a chance like other fellows. Well--never mind! Don't let's talk\nabout it any more.\"\n\nHere Pallister laid his hand somewhat timidly on Geoff's arm.\n\n\"I didn't mean to vex you,\" he said in a very small voice.\n\nGeoff turned his gaze from Jack for a moment. Pallister's troubled\ncountenance touched him.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said with a fleeting smile, at the same time\ngiving a reassuring pat to the hand that lay on his arm. Then he forgot\nall about that youth again, and looked with worried eyes at his friend\nonce more.\n\nJack was dismally wiping his fingers free from plaster. This task\ncompleted, he stood up.\n\n\"I may just as well go home,\" he said, \"there's nothing for me to do\nhere. I--I shall have to think about what new piece of work I can\ncommence.\"\n\n\"What rubbish!\" cried Geoff encouragingly, putting his hands on Jack's\nshoulders and giving them an affectionate squeeze. Then pushing him back\ninto the vacated seat: \"Whatever should you go home for? You can think\nquite as well here, you dear old duffer, and we can help you. I'm\nawfully sorry about Winborough, though I know that does no good, does\nit? But look here, Jack. I know a few other people of public interest.\nWe'll find someone else quite as good for our purpose to fill the\nbreach. I'll see to it for you. Now, who shall it be? What about----\"\n\nBut before he could make any suggestion Pallister interposed eagerly.\n\n\"I say, what about himself, Jackie, my boy? Since he is going to do such\na romantic story-bookish thing as marry the most beautiful model alive,\nit will make him a far more interesting person than old Winborough has\nbeen for many a year. If you could sculpt a bust of Miss Stornway also,\nso that you could exhibit the two together at the Academy or\nsomewhere--why, everybody would be planking down their shilling just to\nsee your work; your name would be in everybody's mouth; orders would\ncome rolling in; you'd make your reputation in a day. Now, isn't that a\nbrilliant idea of mine? We're always forgetting the little fact that\nGeoff really is an important person. But he is, you know, both as the\nrising great artist and as a future peer.\"\n\nJack hardly waited for the conclusion of this speech before he\ninterposed. There was already a fresh note of hope in his voice.\n\n\"It's perfectly true--it is indeed. Not all that talk about orders\nrolling in and reputations made in a day. I know that sort of thing\ndoesn't happen. But what he said about you, Geoff, was true. If you\nwould only sit for me, it would be every whit as helpful as if Lord\nWinborough had done so. As you say, Pallister, even more valuable, as\nthis marriage with Miss Stornway is quite certain to arouse interest.\nWill you consent?\"\n\nThe proposed victim laughed.\n\n\"I didn't bargain for this,\" he declared. \"Perhaps, after all, you had\nbetter go home, Jack, and do your thinking there, away from this young\nman and his brilliant ideas!\"\n\n\"So even you can't deny it is a splendid solution of the difficulty!\"\ndeclared Pallister gleefully.\n\nEvidently Jack was of the same way of thinking. The sullen unhappy\nexpression had entirely vanished from his features.\n\n\"Please do, Geoff,\" he said very earnestly; and this proved\nall-sufficient. His friend gave the required promise without further\nhesitation.\n\n\"But I must warn you,\" he went on, \"that I am going away--out of\nEngland--very soon indeed. It may be several months before I can sit for\nyou. Hadn't you better choose someone else, after all?\"\n\nBut Jack was adamant.\n\n\"No indeed. But I can take a mask now, can't I? Then with its aid I can\nget well forward without you. You'll let me do it at once, won't you?\nEverything is ready.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, I can't stop long. I've got to get down to the\nCity.\"\n\n\"But a mask is quite a short job. It can easily be finished before\nlunch.\"\n\nThis was not to be gainsaid, and the afternoon gave more than sufficient\ntime for Geoff's other still more urgent affairs. Thus he gave in with\nthe brief remark--\n\n\"Set to work, then.\"\n\nPallister indulged in a leap of delight.\n\n\"Now, Jack! How do we start? What can I do?\"\n\n\"First of all, hand Geoff that blouse, while I bring in the materials.\"\n\nPallister seized the clean holland overall, and while Geoff removed his\ncoat and obediently arrayed himself therein, the youth sped away to lend\nhis indispensable assistance in the plaster-room.\n\nSoon all was ready. The long divan was drawn forward. Geoff lay down,\nmoving his head restlessly until it was endurably at ease amid the\nprotecting towels. Jack wrapped further cloths carefully over the fair\nhair, tucked yet another round his subject's neck, then set to work with\ncold-cream, quills and cotton wool.\n\n\"Don't forget that when you raise your left hand it means 'yes,' and\nyour right means 'no,'\" he said, as he proceeded to mix the plaster with\nwarm water. After a moment he announced, \"It's all ready now.\"\n\n\"Forge ahead, then,\" said Geoff cheerfully, as he noisily and\nostentatiously sucked in a last draught of fresh air. Then he smiled,\nbut seeing the first spoonful of liquid plaster approaching his face, he\nshut his eyes quickly, composed his features, and resigned himself to\nfate.\n\nAfter the first layer was safely on, the two strings that were required\nfor cutting up the mask were laid in place and pressed down firmly. Then\nthe remainder of the plaster was used. Pallister watched every stage\nwith eager interest.\n\n\"Can you hear anything now?\" he queried.\n\n\"Our voices even don't reach him unless we shout very loudly, but all\nthe time he is hearing his own heart thud, thud, thudding. I know!\"\n\nThey waited in silence until the moment should be reached when the\nplaster was in a fit condition for Jack to draw up the two strings and\nthus divide the mask. As they sat there a slight tumult was heard in the\nstreet without. It was merely a couple of dogs fighting, yet under any\ncircumstances Pallister found it impossible to remain impervious to\nexternal excitements. In an instant he was at the window.\n\n\"Pooh! I hoped it was a mad dog, but it's only a silly fight, and now\neven that's over,\" he remarked in disgusted tones.\n\nHe was turning away, when suddenly he stopped short, bent forward, then\nbeckoned excitedly to Jack.\n\n\"I say, Do come here! Hurry up and look. Don't you dare grumble at your\nluck again, for I'll eat my hat if here isn't your long-sought 'Belle\nDame'! Isn't that just the red hair and pale little face you want?\"\n\nIn a second Jack was by his side. His glance followed Pallister's\ndirecting finger, and he positively gasped.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" he cried excitedly, staring down into the street. \"It's\nexactly what I've been looking for! Pallister, it's like a dream!\"\n\nUndeniably the girl was uncommon--beautiful in her own curious\nstyle--individual--almost peculiar.\n\n\"But do you think she would pose for you? It's wildly unlikely that she\nshould just happen to be a model.\"\n\nSome magnetic wave had apparently drawn the passing damsel's attention\nupwards towards Pallister. She saw him beckon; saw another masculine\nfigure appear by his side in response to the summons. She had cast down\nher eyes demurely enough and walked on, but at this moment she looked\nback, flashing a quick glance upwards over her shoulder. Seeing the two\nmen gazing as if spellbound at her retreating figure, she smiled at\nthem. It was a fleeting smile, wicked and subtle, narrowing her eyes and\nbringing alluring dimples into either cheek. Then she passed on her way.\n\n\"I'm positive she would sit for you, if you paid her enough,\" commented\nPallister sagely. \"Hi, there! Hi!--Miss!\"\n\nBut the girl did not hear his voice.\n\nAnd then Jack fell away from grace. The hand of ambition beckoned, and\nthe faint whisperings of duty proved impotent to stay his following\nsteps.\n\n\"I must go; I must get her!\" he declared hoarsely, shaken from his\nhabitual calm. \"My luck will indeed turn now. I shall win everything\nfrom that picture. It will drive me mad never to paint it. Pallister,\nyou can keep an eye on Geoff, can't you? He's all right; he wants\nnothing whatsoever but to be left alone. The mask is very nearly ready\nto come off now, but that's a slow job. I can't stop, can I? Geoff won't\nbe scared by the waiting. He's been through it before, you know. You\njust sit quietly by him.\"\n\n\"Trust me; I'll nurse him,\" assented Pallister gaily. \"Buck up, old\nchap, or she'll be gone.\"\n\nBut the remainder of his sentence was wasted upon the atmosphere. Jack\nwas already bounding downstairs, every other thought excluded from his\nmind by the mental picture of a pale-faced girl smiling upwards over her\nshoulder.\n\n\"I shall succeed now! I shall succeed! I know it--if I can get this girl\nto sit!\"\n\nThus his innermost conviction spoke loudly as he hurried along the busy\nstreet; yet every second the tiny voice of conscience grew more\nclamorous and insistent. Under such urgent stress of circumstances,\nsurely any artist would have maintained that it was forgivable enough to\nhave thus left Geoffrey for several minutes longer than was necessary,\nin what was certainly an unpleasant and possibly a dangerous situation!\nBut knowing Frank Pallister, would not one and all have asserted that\nunder any pretext it was infamous that Jack should abandon his friend to\nso unreliable and careless--let alone totally inexperienced--an\nassistant?\n\n\"I must go back. Soon--almost immediately,\" Jack declared within\nhimself; and with his mind torn in two directions, he hurried on with\nyet more frantic haste in pursuit of this long-desired and widely-sought\nmodel.\n\nMeanwhile, heedless of the instructions to sit by Geoff and watch him,\nPallister adopted the more interesting occupation of following the\npursuit from his post of vantage at the window. He gave Jack an\nencouraging cheer as that young man appeared from out the house, rushed\nthrough the garden and along the road. Suddenly the watcher beheld a\nstate of affairs that filled him with dismay. The quarry turned out of\nthe main road and continued her journey down a side-street, while Jack,\nstill hurrying along the crowded thoroughfare, ran straight over this\ncrossing without so much as thinking to glance down it in his haste. He\npassed it by heedlessly, continuing his now vain journey onwards.\n\nPallister literally danced with distress.\n\n\"He will lose her--oh, the idiot! Hi, Jack! Jack! Round that corner.\"\n\nBut Jack was much too far off to hear this shout. In an instant\nPallister's mind was made up. He alone could save the situation. He made\na dash towards the door.\n\nSuddenly he remembered Geoff, and stopped his hurried rush so abruptly\nthat he slid several yards on the polished boards. But Frank Pallister,\nEsq., that youth of energy and enterprise, was not easily to be baulked\nwhen one of his brilliant ideas was on hand. He sped hastily back to the\ncouch.\n\n\"Hullo, Geoff! I say, Geoff! You all right?\"\n\nThe left hand of the prostrate figure was immediately raised in token of\nassent. With his mind now perfectly at ease, Pallister darted\ndownstairs. He was in a glow of self-appreciation. What resource he\nshowed in all emergencies! What a truly valuable all-round friend he\nwas, to be sure!\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER XLII\n\n                          THE _Coup de Gr\u00e2ce_\n\n\nThen for a brief space of time the studio remained deserted, save for\nthe prostrate figure lying motionless upon the couch. A big blue-bottle\nfly buzzed around the open window, flinging itself at intervals noisily\nagainst the glass. From the street without arose the low hum of passing\ntraffic. Otherwise a dull, peaceful silence held sway.\n\nBut in the adjoining chamber sat one from whom all peace was far remote.\nEven as Pallister had darted down the front stairs, Evarne had entered\nfrom Langthorne Place and gained the plaster-room. An irresistible force\nhad drawn her back to the vicinity of her lover and her enemy; but still\nunwilling to make her presence known to them, she had crept softly into\nthe one little room to which access was possible without entering the\nstudio.\n\nAs she sat there waiting--waiting for she knew not what--every nerve in\nher body thrilled painfully. Restless nights and lack of food had\nrendered her unfitted to cope with the continuous train of cruel,\ntearing emotions that had fallen to her lot that morning. The gnawing\nanxiety of the last half-hour had been nigh unendurable. A very few\nseconds of this further suspense, this acute nerve-strain, and she\nuttered an audible groan, forced from her lips by both mental and\nphysical distress.\n\nStartled by the sound, she tried to turn her thoughts from the present\nto all that was most bright in the future.\n\n\"So--we are to be married to-morrow. Oh, Geoff, Geoff, my darling!\"\n\nBut anxiety and apprehension beset her too closely to be avoided. Close\nupon this blissful reflection followed another.\n\n\"Then--after that--not only my dear one's happiness, but my life--my\nvery life--depend upon that vile creature here, to whom nothing is\nsacred. Am I doing right by Geoff? Oh, if I could only rid myself of\nthese doubts!\"\n\nShe sighed and twisted her hands together. Then composed herself to\nthought once more.\n\n\"But my mind was fully convinced, my conscience upheld me surely enough\nuntil Morris came. Would to Heaven the vessel that brought him to\nEngland had sunk to the bottom of the sea, and that he lay silenced\nforever beneath the waters.\"\n\nAgain she sighed. Again she thought.\n\n\"Ah me! If these were but the times when witches reigned, gladly would I\nsell my very soul to the powers of evil in return for a charm--a\nspell--to ensure that man's eternal silence.\"\n\nUnder the stress of such desperate desires, she found it impossible to\nremain quietly seated. Rising, she moved restlessly and without object\nto and fro from end to end of the little room. Suddenly she noticed that\nher dress had brushed against the table, and become slightly soiled with\nplaster. It was but a trifling matter, but as she shook and brushed it\nclean again, a sudden hot anger burned in her veins.\n\n\"It is outrageous!\" she said fiercely within herself--\"outrageous, that\nI should be thus forced to hide, with fear and trembling, in back rooms!\nOh, how I hate that man! How he degrades me! How he has cursed my life!\nFrom the very first hour we met he has dragged me steadily downwards,\nand now--now--he is going to use his own sin to damn all the remainder\nof my life!\n\n\"Promises--what does that word mean to Morris Kenyon? Did he not\npromise my father to watch over me--to guard me--and how did he keep\nhis word? And what promises did he not make to me--oh, again and\nagain!--in what tender, earnest tones; and then--liar, liar! Morris\ntalking morality to me! What right has he to do that? What about\nhimself? What injustice, what evil, equals that of a man--middle-aged,\nwise in the world, strong, clever--using every advantage to win a\nyoung girl, and then--then--pretending that, even in his eyes, his own\nsuccess renders the girl, not himself, infamous for ever?\"\n\nShe clenched her hands violently. The bright colour that had flooded her\ncheeks mounted to her temples.\n\n\"I hate him--I loathe him! But, Heaven, how I fear him! If he\nshould--oh, if he dares! If he only dares, I'll--I'll....\"\n\nIn the heat of this sudden but enduring paroxysm of anger she lost the\npower of further thought. Her throat swelled, and before she could\ncontrol herself she had given utterance to a series of half-sobbing,\nhalf-moaning cries of misery and baffled rage. Frantically she pressed\nboth hands with desperate energy across her lips. She had but little\nself-control left; only by physical force could she possibly stay those\ncries of fear and anguish.\n\nThen she stood motionless, glued to the spot by apprehension. Surely the\nmen in the next room must have heard that wild lamentation? She strained\nher ears for the sound of footsteps. Her breast shook with the\nconvulsive pantings of rage that is forced to subdue itself. Every throb\nof her heart came as a sharp pang.\n\nNo sound--no sound whatsoever. Suddenly she reeled against the table,\nclutching at it for support. A terrible idea--a conviction--had now\nassailed her. Morris was doubtless even at this moment telling her\nsecret to his cousin. Ah--she knew! A whispered conversation was going\non in that strangely silent studio. Once again she was being cruelly\nbetrayed by that man. This was surely more than flesh and blood could be\ncalled upon to endure.\n\nIn an instant all the tigress in her nature sprang eager and palpitating\nto the fore. Without a moment's hesitation she rushed wildly into the\npassage, and flung open the door of the studio.\n\nOn the threshold she stopped short in amazement. Solitude, save for the\nprostrate form upon the couch.\n\n\"Wherever are Geoff and Mr. Hardy and Pallister? Where can they have\ngone, to leave Morris alone in this manner?\"\n\nEven in the midst of her excitement, a plausible reason for the absence\nof at least one of the trio suggested itself.\n\n\"Oh, of course, Geoff had doubtless gone down to Doctors Commons to get\nthat licence.\"\n\nThen, shaken by a fresh access of indignation:\n\n\"And because of this vile creature here it may prove futile--a mere\npiece of waste paper! Or it may turn out to be really my death-warrant.\nOh, my God, I cannot endure to look at him--to be beneath the same\nroof!\"\n\nAnd then, such are the powers of imagination, that, believing the man\nwho lay before her to be him whom she had such ample cause to fear and\nhate, she instinctively knit her brows and drew a sharp breath audibly\nbetween her teeth, huddling her hands together on her chest with an\nactual shudder of repulsion.\n\nAnd verily, even Love's penetration could scarce be blamed for not here\ndiscerning the truth. Even had Evarne been told to distinguish between\nher lover and her enemy under such conditions, the task would have\nbordered upon the impossible. With face and head completely covered,\nwith hands strangely identical, with height and build so similar, and\nyet further disguised by an all-concealing painting-blouse, the most\nloving eye might easily have blundered.\n\nBut Evarne did not doubt--did not question. The very last words she had\nheard spoken in that studio were to the effect that Morris had come on\npurpose to submit himself to this operation. What room, then, was there\nfor suspicion regarding the identity of this man whose face was\nconcealed with the plaster mask? Upon the first glance she averted her\neyes, standing trembling. After a minute of enduring this agony of\nrepulsion she spoke aloud--unconsciously aloud--quite softly to herself.\nHer voice, though low, was curiously discordant and hoarse, pulsating\nwith the powerful emotions that were so rapidly proving more than she\ncould bear.\n\n\"Oh, it's wicked--it's cruel--it's unjust! He will tell everything after\nI'm married. He will glory in it. I know him. He is a devil incarnate!\nWhat have we done, Geoff and I, that we should be tortured here on\nearth? Oh, what can I do to save us both--what can I do? To be so\nhelpless--to be driven utterly helpless into a corner like this--oh, I\ncan't--I can't endure it! What am I to do? Tell me--tell me! I want\nhelp--help of any kind. Is there nothing Here or There can hear and help\nme?\"\n\nHer voice faded away. She stood, turning her head from side to side,\nlooking around wildly. Her brow contracted itself into deeper furrows.\nIn the silence she unconsciously bit at her finger-nails, tearing one\ndown to the quick--yet she felt no pain.\n\nQuite suddenly there awoke in her memory an almost obliterated\nrecollection. Loudly and wrathfully she cried--\n\n\"Sekhet--you have failed me--you have forsaken me! I prayed to you once.\nNow you must answer my prayer, for I invoke you. You are great now as\never. I demand your help--demand it! How can I ensure that man's eternal\nsilence? Tell me--tell me!\"\n\nShe stood for a moment with trembling forefinger outstretched,\nindicating the motionless form upon the divan. Did she expect some\nmystic voice to respond to her appeal? No sound broke the silence, save\nthe fly which hummed and buzzed and flung itself with blind unavailing\nendeavour against the window-panes.\n\nBut into her brain--that poor brain so tortured and goaded by cruel\nanxiety, by a bitter insult, by a great, passionate love threatened with\ndestruction--sprang the instinctive thought of that prim\u00e6val resource:\n\n\"Death! Death! Only death can bring eternal silence!\"\n\nSwiftly, yet very surely, a strange, unfamiliar influence had enwrapped\nthis rebel against Fate. Who can declare authoritatively what supreme\nPower behind the Veil she had not summoned in that moment's distraught\nand reckless invocation? Be that as it may, she became obsessed by one\nof those all-mighty, dominating impulses that conquer the will, the\njudgment, even the desire; that crush down previously accepted ideas of\nright and wrong, forcing a fresh, oft-times dreaded, idea masterfully\ninto a shrinking heart and mind.\n\nAnd the message that had come to Evarne was terrible--terrific!\n\n\"Call Death to your aid! Kill your enemy! Kill him while there is yet\ntime!\"\n\nEven through the passion of rage that shook her, she felt a momentary\nsubduing chill of horror. She pressed her hands to either cheek, and\nwith strained features, parted lips and staring, dilated eyes, gazed\nwildly into vacancy.\n\nBut this horrible inspiration was as a white light suddenly illuminating\nthe dense dark path along which she had been groping. She laughed--a low\nlaugh--terrible, for there was no ring of mirth therein.\n\n\"It is only justice--justice--justice--justice!\" she cried, her voice\nrising upon every word. \"He is the devil's emissary. The world will be\nwell rid of him. It is justice--justice--justice!\"\n\nShe had no more consecutive thoughts, no more reflection, no more\nhesitation. But one word rang in her mind. Justice! Justice! Justice!\nShe rushed across the room with wild haste, and seized upon Andromache's\ngolden fetter that lay upon a chair. With anger, fiery indignation and\nhatred, terror and mad love raging within her brain, all other emotions\nwere effectively excluded. Pity, caution, lawfulness, fear of\nconsequences--none of these found any place within her spirit in that\ndreadful hour. If the souls of the dead can verily watch over those they\nloved in life, broken indeed must be their heavenly peace and happiness.\nRather they must be oft-times in hell.\n\nSoftly she fastened one fetter around a strong portion of the openwork\ncarved wooden back of the couch; then, without a moment's warning, the\nhandcuff at the other end of the chain was snapped round the nearest\nwrist of the prostrate figure. Futile was the immediate startled effort\nof the death-doomed man to rise. In an instant Evarne had dragged away\nthose two quills through which was drawn the breath of life, and had\npressed the still slightly unset plaster over the tiny holes. Then\nsinking on her knees, she seized her victim's remaining arm, clutching\nit to her breast with a desperate vigour.\n\nHer eyes were convulsively shut, her lips parted over clenched teeth, as\nfor what seemed an interminable period she was flung to and fro by the\nfrenzied struggles of the strong arm she held captive. But gradually her\ntask grew easier. Very soon that dire deed had taken its place amid the\nrecord of things done.\n\nCautiously she slackened her grasp. The arm, released, drooped heavily\ndownwards from its shoulder, the hand resting inertly upon the floor.\nEvarne rose to her feet. Unfastening both ends of the golden fetter, she\nflung it back upon the chair, then left the studio without another\nglance at the twisted, distorted form of that dead man whose lips would\nspeak no more words, either of devotion or of malice.\n\nDeliberately she washed the plaster from her fingers. Her glance was\nfirm and high, her bearing resolute and undaunted. Yet, as she dried her\nhands, she suddenly paused, and, leaning heavily on the edge of the\nlittle sink, uttered a long, trembling sigh such as can well up only\nfrom a cruelly over-burdened heart--a low, piteous moan--a stifled wail\nof despair.\n\n\"Oh, Geoff, Geoff! What am I? What have I become for your sake?\"\n\nShe went out again into Langthorne Place and walked away. Only about\nfive minutes had passed since she trod that pavement before, yet now...?\nHer pulses throbbed wildly, but she was assailed by no regret, no trace\nof self-reproach. She was appalled by, yet exalted in, her desperate\ndeed. She was triumphant. She had conquered!\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nJack, hastily returning, almost collided with Pallister, who issued from\nthe side-street.\n\n\"So we've lost your unique 'Belle Dame,' worse luck to us! And a\nprecious couple we must look out here, with no hats, and smeared\npainting-blouses and....\"\n\nBut the remaining words died away at the sight of Jack's expression of\nundisguised alarm.\n\n\"Pallister! You surely haven't left Geoff alone! How infamous! Oh, how\ncould you?\"\n\nWithout waiting for any answer he darted across the road and ran with\nall speed for the studio.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" declared Pallister, somewhat subdued, hurrying\nafter him. \"He's all right. What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't speak to me! How could you leave him?\" was the sole response.\n\n\"Well, you seem to forget you did it yourself, if it's such a crime,\"\nPallister replied tartly.\n\n\"More blame to me! But I left him in your charge; you left him\nalone--surely that makes all the difference. Good gracious,\nthough--whatever possessed me? You're as irresponsible as a child, and I\nknew it--I knew it!\"\n\nHe turned into the garden, and in a minute was bounding upstairs,\nclosely followed by the indignant Pallister.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nA quarter of an hour later, Evarne, pale yet supremely beautiful in her\nblush-rose gown, in her turn mounted the stairs. As she came in sight of\nthe front door of the flat she saw that it stood wide open. From it was\nwafted faintly a piteous sound of sobbing and wailing.\n\n\"I suppose some will mourn Morris. I did not remember that,\" she\nreflected, as she entered and closed the front door behind her. Then,\nmaking her way across the hall to the studio, she went in, inquiring in\nsplendidly feigned surprise and alarm, \"What is the matter? What has\nhappened?\"\n\nPoor Pallister was lying prostrate on the floor near the window, his\nhands, flung over his head, convulsively grasping great masses of fur\nthat he had torn from the bearskin rug by which he lay. His whole body\nwas writhing beneath choking, rending sobs. From him, Evarne slowly\nturned her gaze on Jack, who was seated near the couch. He, too, was\nshaking violently from head to foot; but as regards fixity of\nexpression, hue and voluntary action, he might have been a figure of\ndespair cut from marble.\n\nA sudden pain darted through Evarne's brow. Unnerved by the display of\nsuch unexpected and unrestrained emotion, she was forced to lean against\nthe side of the doorway for support, while her white face grew paler\nstill.\n\n\"What--oh, I--what?\"\n\nNone responded to her incoherent words. A cold chill encircled her. In\nthe hot studio she shivered as in wintry weather.\n\n\"What has happened to Lord Winborough? Oh--where's? I want him quickly.\nI must see him, I tell you. Where is he?\"\n\nJack rose from his chair.\n\n\"Go away--go away!\" he breathed. \"I--I can't--you mustn't know. Go\naway!\"\n\nEvarne was fast losing her forced calmness. She was assailed by a\ndesperate longing to gain new courage from the ever-tender eyes of the\nman who loved her.\n\n\"I will go! I want to! I'm frightened here! But where is Geoff? Tell me,\nJack--tell me! Send for him!\"\n\n\"Geoff! Geoff!\" wailed Pallister.\n\nEvarne gave a violent start, and without moving from the doorway against\nwhich she was leaning, she bent her body forward in Pallister's\ndirection.\n\n\"Why do you also call for him?\" she queried.\n\nThe only response was a farther lament.\n\n\"Geoff, come back! Oh, Geoff, how could I leave you?\"\n\nStill bending forward, she swayed round towards Jack. Then her reluctant\nglance wandered from him to the form upon the couch. The mask had been\nremoved, exposing a terrible face beneath, distorted somewhat,\ndisfigured with fearsome livid patches and blue swollen lips. Around the\nmouth and nose clung mucus froth.\n\nEvarne choked, struggling with sickness; but suddenly she sprang forward\nand seized Jack by the shoulders with unnatural strength.\n\n\"If you don't tell me where Geoff is, I'll--I'll----\"\n\nThe menacing tones ceased abruptly, as Jack put out his shaking hands\nand grasped her wrists.\n\n\"I see you must be told. Well, then--this is it! He took his cousin's\nplace, Evarne, and we--we left him alone--and--and something happened!\"\n\nFor one long minute absolute silence reigned within the room. Pallister\nceased sobbing and held his breath. Evarne did not speak, but stared at\nJack with unwinking gaze. He saw a fearsome change steal over her face.\nEvery feature seemed to alter, to be transformed under his very eyes,\nbecoming unrecognisable--horrible! Without warning, she pushed him\nviolently away, and with a few rapid steps was by the side of the dead\nman. She laid her hand upon the fair hair.\n\n\"So it is you I have killed, Geoff!\" she said, quietly enough.\n\n\"God in Heaven, what?\" shouted Jack at the top of his voice.\n\nEvarne did not speak, but suddenly plunging her hands through her damp\nhair she began to scream--wild, piercing shrieks that chilled the blood\nof those who heard. Nothing could stay her--until her voice gave way.\nStill she screamed on spasmodically, producing merely horrible and\ndiscordant sounds.\n\nLoud shouts arose from the street. A policeman's shrill whistle blew\nfrantically again and again.\n\nAnd then Evarne commenced to laugh, a hoarse, derisive gurgle.\n\n\"Do you hear that laughter?\" she cried huskily. \"It is Morris Kenyon. It\nis funny for him, isn't it? And it's--yes--I see--that cat-faced\ngoddess--Sekhet! So you all think the game is played out, do you? We'll\nsee.\"\n\nShe clasped her arms around the dead form, pressing it tightly to her\nbreast. She laid her cheek to Geoff's, and so rose with her white,\ndistorted face besmeared and sullied.\n\nNow loud continuous blows were resounding on the outer door. The\nelectric bell rang forth unintermittently.\n\nWith swaying steps Evarne crossed the room. Pallister instinctively\nshrank back as the terrible spectacle advanced in his direction. At this\na pair of bloodshot eyes were turned upon him, while a strained voice\nwhispered calmly enough--\n\n\"Avoid Sekhet--tell everyone what I said. Never, never love too much. It\nis always dreadful in some way--always! Sooner or later--always! I must\ngo now and tell Geoff everything myself.\"\n\nThen, ere they could realise what was next to happen, she had put one\nknee on the window-sill and flung up her arms wildly. Instinctively both\nmen rushed forward, but, happily, too late!\n\nIn another instant a broken mass lay peacefully unconscious forever upon\nthe green bosom of Earth--our Mother.\n\n\n\n                           Transcriber Notes:\n\nPassages in italics were indicated by _underscores_.\n\nSmall caps were replaced with ALL CAPS.\n\nThroughout the document, the oe ligature was replaced with \"oe\".\n\nThroughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of the\nspeakers.

    "d till 1757.\n\nIn 1742 Thomas succeeded to a canonry of St. Paul's, and held it till 1748. In 1742 he had been made one of George II's chaplains, and preached the Boyle lectures, which he did not publish; and, having secured the favour of the king when Prince of Wales, he was given the bishopric of Peterborough, and consecrated at Lambeth Palace on 4 October 1747.\n\nIn 1752 Thomas was selected to succeed Thomas Hayter as preceptor to the young Prince of Wales, later George III, James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave being governor; these appointments were directed against the influence of the Princess Dowager. In 1757 he followed John Gilbert as bishop of Salisbury(and ex officio Chancellor of the Order of the Garter) and also as clerk of the closet, and in 1761 was translated to Winchester in succession to Benjamin Hoadly.\n\nThomas died at Winchester Palace, on 1 May 1781, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. There are portraits of the bishop at the palaces of Salisbury and Lambeth, and a fine mezzotint engraving (three-quarter length in robes of the Garter) by R. Sayer from a picture by Benjamin Wilson, published on 24 January 1771.\n\nWorks\nJohn Thomas published about ten works, mainly sermons.\n\nFamily\nThomas married Susan, daughter of Thomas Mulso of Twywell, Northamptonshire; her brother Thomas married the bishop's sister, and their daughter, Mrs. Hester Chapone, spent much of her time after her husband's death with her uncle and aunt at Farnham Castle. Mrs. Thomas died on 19 November 1778, leaving three daughters:\n Susanna Thomas, married Newton Ogle, Dean of Winchester;\n Anne Thomas, married William Buller, Bishop of Exeter;\n Hester Thomas, married Rear Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, 1st Baronet.\n\nNotes\n\nAttribution\n\nCategory:1696 births\nCategory:1781 deaths\nCategory:People educated at Charterhouse School\nCategory:Fellows of All Souls College, Oxford\nCategory:Bishops of Peterborough\nCategory:Bishops of Salisbury\nCategory:Bishops of Winchester\nCategory:Clerks of the Closet\nCategory:Chancellors of the Order of the Garter",

    "tart Sunday at Rogers Centre by his Bills counterpart, Chan Gailey, Shanahan had no answers during the game or afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one to take,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the first time in his career as a head coach or assistant, Shanahan said he was part of an offense that didn\u2019t score. Obviously, the offense was awful, producing only 178 total net yards. The total included 26 yards rushing, with a 2.2-yard average.\n\nThe defense also continued to do its part.\n\nShanahan decided he needed to help defensive coordinator Jim Haslett after Washington gave up 829 yards in consecutive losses to Philadelphia and Carolina. He spent more time working with the defense in practice \u2014 and the Bills still produced 390 yards.\n\nAnd there was confusion in the Redskins\u2019 secondary. So much, in fact, that inside linebacker London Fletcher lost it during the third quarter.\n\nA blown coverage resulted in the Bills taking a 20-0 lead on a 15-yard touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick to tight end Scott Chandler. Following the play, Fletcher was shown on television shouting at a teammate who wasn\u2019t in the camera\u2019s view. Strong safety LaRon Landry said Fletcher was upset at him.\n\nCornerback DeAngelo Hall played peacemaker, trying to console Washington\u2019s defensive captain. \u201cIt happens in the emotion of a football game,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cEspecially when there\u2019s a missed assignment.\u201d\n\nThis was a well-prepared football team? \u201cNo question about it,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nOn offense and defense, Gailey and his staff had the Bills ready to roll. Shanahan and his guys needed to deliver creative counterpunches on offense and be rock-solid in their execution on defense. None of that happened.\n\nShanahan\u2019s coaching couldn\u2019t have overcome everything that went wrong against the Bills. But he delivered nothing. With the Redskins desperately seeking a spark \u2014 anything \u2014 the Great Innovator had no solution.\n\nWere the Shanahans just hoping their beloved system eventually would succeed? They\u2019ve been waiting on it since they arrived at Redskins Park.\n\nWashington\u2019s pass protection was awful. Often, it was nonexistent. Buffalo entered the game last in the league with four sacks. By halftime, the Bills had doubled their season total. They finished with nine.\n\nSeveral key performers on Washington\u2019s offense are injured, including two starting linemen. Injuries alone, however, do not explain the level of ineptitude on display from the Redskins for the entire game. Or what has occurred the past three.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s be clear about this: The injured Redskins aren\u2019t that good. They\u2019re important to Washington\u2019s offensive scheme. But the guys the Redskins lost weren\u2019t headed to the Pro Bowl this season.\n\nWashington\u2019s offensive line was significantly better in the Week 7 loss to Carolina. Regression of this kind, in only one week, has nothing to do with the team\u2019s talent level. This was about coaching. That\u2019s Shanahan\u2019s department.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Shanahan said in response to a query about whatever it was the offensive line was attempting to do against the Bills. \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment.\u201d\n\nIn his second start for Washington, quarterback John Beck had no chance. At halftime, the Redskins trailed, 13-0. Game over. It was as clear as Shanahan\u2019s rotten judgment in picking Redskins quarterbacks. I doubt there are many quarterbacks who would have been effective Sunday behind the Redskins\u2019 line.\n\nBeck is trying to establish himself in bad working conditions. That\u2019s a tough break.\n\nDuring those rare moments when things went as planned, however, Beck didn\u2019t do anything extraordinary. In his first start since the 2007 season, last week against Carolina, the inexperienced 30-year-old did some good things in the second half.\n\nProblem is, the Redskins\u2019 offensive line probably won\u2019t be much better at any point this season.\n\nEven when left tackle Trent Williams returns, the unit has major limitations. With that backdrop, it could be very difficult for the Shanahans to evaluate Beck. They can\u2019t waste any more time tinkering with the game\u2019s most important position.\n\nReality is, neither Beck nor Grossman is the short- or long-term answer at quarterback. In a perfect world, the offensive line would do its job well enough to help the Shanahans determine whether Beck could provide a bridge to Washington\u2019s next quarterback of the future, wherever he is at the moment.\n\nMike and Kyle no longer have that luxury. They\u2019ll have to ride it out with Beck for the remainder of the season (with Grossman as the other option, that\u2019s the only smart move), and then bring in at least two new quarterbacks for next season.\n\nIn their second year under Shanahan, the Redskins shouldn\u2019t be in such a mess. Something needs to change. Shanahan must prove he\u2019s capable of fixing this \u2014 or step aside for someone who can.\n\nComments our editors find particularly useful or relevant are displayed in Top Comments, as are comments by users with these badges: .

    "nts. Compared with placebo, ramelteon had no statistically significant effect on mean arterial oxygen percent saturation (SaO(2)) for the entire night (92.9 vs 92.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.6 to 0.6; P = 0.972), for each of the 8 h of the night, for each sleep stage (awake, rapid eye movement, nonrapid eye movement) or for the percentage of the night that SaO(2) was less than 85 and 90%. The mean apnea-hypopnea index was similar between ramelteon and placebo groups (9.0 vs 8.3; 95% CI, -1.5 to 3.0; P = 0.515). Polysomnography documented a significant increase in total sleep time (380.6 vs 353.6, P = 0.015), sleep efficiency (79.3 vs 73.7, P = 0.017), and number of awakenings (11.1 vs 9.5, P = 0.036) with ramelteon vs placebo. Other polysomnography and subject-reported sleep measures were comparable between groups. Only one adverse event was reported; it was not considered treatment related.

    "ambiguously establish the native multimeric structure of amaranthin as a homodimer. These absolute molecular weight methods and the calculated Stokes radius (27.2 A) indicate that the amaranthin dimer is highly compact relative to typical globular proteins, and thus, anomalous molecular weight values are obtained when simple size exclusion chromatography is used to determine the molecular weight of amaranthin. Studies with a homobifunctional cross-linking reagent and amaranthin further support the existence of a lectin homodimer. The stoichiometry of carbohydrate binding was determined to be one T-disaccharide-binding site per amaranthin subunit (Ka = 3.6 X 10(5) M-1). Amaranthin exhibits hydrophobic-binding properties as indicated by binding of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonate (Ka = 3.6 X 10(3) M-1) and 6-toluidinyl-2-naphthalenesulfonate (Ka = 2 X 10(4) M-1).

December futures are used in this study for each of those markets. Keep in mind that most ETN index prices are based on a mix of cash commodities and futures, as well as Treasury securities and other variables. Thus, December futures are used simply to show the relatively close correlation between ETNs and as a dependable benchmark price.\n\nThe charts indicate that for the period of April to mid-September 2012, the spread between gold and silver was much wider and potentially more profitable than the distance at any time between wheat and corn. In the previous study of the gold-silver spread, gold was stable and silver was the more volatile member of the pair. The current chart confirms this relationship to a surprising extent. Starting in early April, by the end of June silver had a cumulative percent price decline of almost 20%, while gold was stable with almost zero price change. Silver rebounded by 25% to become equal to gold later in September.\n\nSilver futures and the silver ETN move together. A spread or hedge trade of silver vs. gold could have used either the ETN or December futures with approximately equal results. With the tight relationship between each ETN and its associated futures contract, a spread between the ETN and December futures would be difficult for all four commodities. This differs from the potential ETN-futures spread noted for the livestock ETN, COW, which is based on a combination of live cattle and lean hog futures (\u201cTrading cattle, hogs and ETNs,\u201d November 2012). The potential of an ETN-futures spread is better in that case because the ETN is based on more than one underlying commodity, which at times allows larger differences for spread trading.",

    "r various group functions, it is particularly useful for adjusting group behaviour in spatial contexts such as food location or route choice ([@BIO033613C11]; [@BIO033613C6]; [@BIO033613C8]). Indeed, group living has been proposed to enhance navigation performance via information-sharing ([@BIO033613C33]). Navigation relies on several behavioural and cognitive processes, such as exploration/sampling effort, decision-making, learning and cue memorisation ([@BIO033613C2]). The use of these processes by a group may be limited by the extent to which cognitive or behavioural similarities between individuals facilitate collective responses.\n\nMost studies on group navigation have focused on collective decision-making as a means of choosing between routes while maintaining group structure ([@BIO033613C7]; [@BIO033613C8]; [@BIO033613C6]). Yet individual variation has been noted in important cognitive processes: some individuals may be better at memorising information from their environment ([@BIO033613C10]), faster or more successful in their decisions ([@BIO033613C4]) or faster learners ([@BIO033613C38]). Interestingly, individual variation in many of these processes has been linked to animal personality ([@BIO033613C13]; [@BIO033613C14]). Animal personality is often described by behavioural traits exhibiting consistent inter-individual differences and intra-individual repeatability ([@BIO033613C42]). A well-studied trait, boldness, is indicated by exploration tendencies and feeding motivation ([@BIO033613C37]), making it a regular predictor of spatial associative learning (e.g. [@BIO033613C38]; [@BIO033613C22]). Although a prominent hypothesis is that bolder animals are faster but less accurate in their decisions ([@BIO033613C4]), often effects manifest independently of these trade-offs. For example, bolder fish may be faster at choosing between locations and faster learning rewarded responses, but not less accurate in their choices than more timid animals ([@BIO033613C38]; [@BIO033613C22]; [@BIO033613C19]). Regardless of these trade-offs, the effects of personality on cognitive performance may also influence how animals work collectively. In particular, personality differences between individuals may predict how they tackle cognitive tasks collectively; the exploration tendencies and reward motivation of group members could affect how they coordinate responses, how they decide, and how they organise, share and utilise information when learning ([@BIO033613C7]).\n\nTo examine whether collective processes of decision-making and learning are affected by the composition of groups, in terms of the individual boldness of their members, we studied the zebrafish *Danio rerio*. Fish were first tested as individuals to determine their levels of boldness ([Fig.\u00a01](#BIO033613F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and were then trained as groups of five, referred to here as shoals, in a spatial-associative learning task. During training, only spatial decisions made by all individuals by reaching a location together were reinforced (reward or punishment), to determine learning specific to a collective response. After reaching a learning criterion, we tested the ability of shoals to reorient, examining their ability to memorise distal cues during training. Animals may simply rely on the memorisation of a response, such as a turning direction, or also on the memorisation of the relative positions of distal cues ([@BIO033613C36]; [@BIO033613C3]). Associating a memorised response to a rewarded location relies on orienting from a familiar starting point. In contrast, the additional memorisation of distal cues can facilitate reorientation from novel starting points by attending to changes in the relative position of these cues towards the correct location (place learning; [@BIO033613C32]). Therefore, reorienting can identify whether learning relies on composite strategies that utilise the memorisation of the relative position of distal cues or simple associations of location to directional-response.Fig. 1.**Latency distributions on a logarithmic scale for the novel-object and feeding test, as exhibited by individuals (*n*=50) ranked by their composite boldness score.**\n\nFirst, we tested the hypothesis that collective decisions, learning and memorisation are related to mean boldness levels, with shoals of bolder composition differing from those with shier composition. Second, we tested the hypothesis that collective decisions, learning and memorisation are predicted by the variance in boldness among shoal members, because large differences in personality inhibit agreement or cooperation. Based on effects by personality composition on group response time in other shoaling species, we expected decision times to be related to boldness, being generally faster for groups of bolder individuals ([@BIO033613C12]). The learning of a collective response and memorisation strategies, such as place learning, have only recently been experimentally studied in fish groups ([@BIO033613C26]), noting both the facilitation of visual-cue memorisation and faster learning by zebrafish in groups. However, the effects of the personality composition of groups on these group processes have not been examined. We predict that links to personality may be indicated due to either differences between individuals in their response tendency or their performance in particular cognitive tasks, with more variable groups reaching lower agreement and cohesion ([@BIO033613C16]), and overall bolder groups being faster to decide and associate food reward to a location \\[such as in individuals, e.g. [@BIO033613C13]; [@BIO033613C14]; [@BIO033613C19]\\].\n\nRESULTS {#s2}\n=======\n\nCollective decisions {#s2a}\n--------------------\n\nAll shoals reached collective decisions within the time limit (\\<5\u2005min) in both the initial and probe trial, but some tended to split before reaching a decision (please see the supplemental information). No significant differences were found between the initial trial (before training) and the probe trial (after training) for either decision times (*R^2^*=0.017; *P*\\>0.05) or the probability of splitting (*R^2^*=0.02; *P*\\>0.05), suggesting consistency in collective behaviour and limited effects from differing individual learning during training. The mean boldness of shoal members did not significantly contribute to the probability of splitting (*R^2^*=0.016; *P*\\>0.05; [Fig.\u00a02](#BIO033613F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}A), and although shoals with members of greater mean boldness exhibited shorter decision times (*R^2^*=-0.73; [Fig.\u00a02](#BIO033613F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}A) the relative effect was not significant (*P*\\>0.05). The only significant predictor was variance in shoal-member boldness, which strongly predicted both collective decision-times (*R^2^*=0.816; *F~1,20~*=9.19, *P*=0.008) and the probability of splitting (*R^2^*=0.482, \u03c7*^2^~1,20~*=13.26, *P*\\<0.001). Groups with greater variance in boldness between their members were more likely to split and took longer to collectively reach an arm ([Fig.\u00a02](#BIO033613F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). Further, consistency in splitting across trials was noted for shoals with greater variance in boldness (ANOVA, *F~3,10~*=15.93, *P*=0.002, *R^2^*=0.820; [Fig.\u00a02](#BIO033613F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}C) and collective decisions took longer when splitting occurred than when not (Welch\\'s *t*=4.15, *P*=0.002; [Fig.\u00a02](#BIO033613F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}D). Fig. 2.**Shoal cohesion (probability of splitting) and consequent effects on collective decision-times were influenced by individual boldness differences, but were not linked to majority averages in boldness.** (A) The mean boldness of shoal members (5% trimmed to exclude biases by extremely bold or timid fish) had a negative, non-significant, effect on mean decision times between initial and probe trial (black line and marks), but no effect on splitting probability (grey curve and marks) as indicated by regression models (decision times: linear, probability of splitting: binomial). (B) In contrast, the variance in boldness within shoals (mean average deviation of all fish) positively predicted the probability of splitting at probe and initial trials (grey curve and marks) and the mean decision times between initial and probe trial (black line and marks). (C) The level of consistency in splitting between initial and probe trials was greater for shoals with higher variance in boldness (Zero splitting:mean MAD=0.225, one trial: mean MAD=0.279, two trials: mean MAD=1.26; ANOVA, *P*\\<0.01) and (D) shoals took longer to reach a decision if they split (split: mean=21.82\u00b13\u2005s.e.m., no split: mean=72.8\u00b112\u2005s.e.m.; Welch\\'s *t*, *P*\\<0.01).\n\nDecision accuracy (number of erroneous decisions during training) was only weakly predicted by the mean of shoal-member boldness (*R^2^*=0.127; *\u03c7^2^*=8.19, *P*\\<0.05), but was not significantly predicted by the probability of splitting decision (*R^2^*\\<0.04; *P*\\>0.05). Contrary to predicted speed--accuracy trade-offs ([@BIO033613C4]), the number of erroneous decisions during training did not significantly correlate with the time shoals needed to decide in either the initial or the probe trial (*r~s~*\\<0.2, *P*\\>0.05).\n\nCollective learning {#s2b}\n-------------------\n\nAll shoals met the collective learning criterion of all fish being simultaneously in the rewarded location for eight/ten trials over three consecutive days ([Fig.\u00a03](#BIO033613F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The rate of learning (number of days to reach criterion) was negatively related to the number of erroneous choices during training (i.e. choosing the punished arm) (*R^2^*=\u22120.945, *\u03c7^2^~1,10~*=3.99, *P*=0.046; [Fig.\u00a03](#BIO033613F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, learning rate was not significantly predicted by the variance and the mean of shoal-member boldness, or the likelihood of splitting (*R^2^*\\<0.04; *P*\\>0.05). Fig. 3.**Shoals that made more erroneous trials during training (black bars) also took more days to learn (grey bars), but a greater than chance majority of shoals was able to memorise place.** Inset: proportion of shoals reorienting at probe trial, showing place learning. Shoals (*n*=10) are ordered by increasing number of error counts and marked (cross) if they showed place learning (\\**P*\\<0.05, binomial-test).\n\nAt probe trials from the new starting point in the top arm, which was blocked during training, all shoals reached one of the arms collectively (i.e. were at the same arm together before the 5\u2005min), but the ability to reorient to the arm rewarded during training was unrelated to the variance and the mean of shoal-member boldness or the likelihood of splitting (*R^2^*\\<0.04; *P*\\>0.05). Indeed, the majority of shoals (eight/ten) showed preference for reaching the rewarded arm significantly more than predicted by chance (proportion\\>0.5: *z~10~*=1.90, *P*=0.029; [Fig.\u00a03](#BIO033613F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nDISCUSSION {#s3}\n==========\n\nTo collectively reach one of two locations, groups must maintain cohesion and structure. This relies on interactions between the individuals comprising the group, a process known as self-organisation ([@BIO033613C35]). The interactions facilitate information sharing ([@BIO033613C7]; [@BIO033613C41]) and in fish this can be in the form of changes in swimming direction, where swimming towards a location by some individuals propagates through the group ([@BIO033613C9]). The extent of the propagation is indicated by the time needed by all individuals to change direction together, which can be limited by individuals deciding to act otherwise ([@BIO033613C7]; [@BIO033613C40]). Here, our findings implicate personality differences between group members in this process. Groups with greater variance in boldness between their members were consistently more likely to split and took longer to collectively reach an arm ([Fig.\u00a02](#BIO033613F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}B,C). Given collective decisions took longer when splitting occurred than when not ([Fig.\u00a02](#BIO033613F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}D), we conclude that the splitting of groups with members more dissimilar in their boldness results in collective decisions taking longer to be reached. The involvement of personality on collective decision speed may reflect a greater tendency by bolder individuals to reach food-rewarded locations ([@BIO033613C19]).\n\nThe relationship of personality differences with cohesion and collective-decision speed proposes that high-variance groups might be disadvantaged when competing for spatially distributed resources. A study on guppies *Poecilia reticulata* did not find mixed groups more disadvantaged than bold groups, but faster at reaching food than shy groups ([@BIO033613C12]). Differences in the effects of personality may depend on the species, but the study in guppies also utilised a categorical separation of bold and shy to compose groups. In contrast, here we measured the variance in boldness score within randomly assembled groups. A higher variance in our shoals is most likely due to the presence of extremely shy individuals, according to individual latency distributions ([Fig.\u00a01](#BIO033613F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The direct effects of high variance on splitting are unclear, as we did not track individuals, but they are possibly driven by intra-group differences in exploration and approach tendency between more greatly differing personalities ([@BIO033613C37]) and possibly due to related differences in sociality ([@BIO033613C39]; [@BIO033613C27]). Another possibility is that differences in boldness correspond to differences in decision-making strategy ([@BIO033613C13]; [@BIO033613C19]), which again would require identifying consistencies in the position individuals occupy in a shoal. Further, different types of splitting may represent different processes. Lateral fission may reflect individuals being less social and actively seeking to split, but rear fission may be the result of either active splitting or passive restraints ([@BIO033613C9]), such as being more fearful and timid ([@BIO033613C37]; [@BIO033613C19]). The splitting of groups with very high variance in personality could possibly lead to the formation of groups with lower variance in personality. While this is yet to be tested, it could be a way for groups to ensure that agreements are reached more easily. Indeed, larger differences in personality can manifest effects on the way fish socialise, cooperate and prioritise reward or risk ([@BIO033613C17]). Alternatively, splitting might be an effect of hierarchical dynamics, with leader initiations and follower delays relying on similarities in personality aspects such as boldness and flexibility ([@BIO033613C16]).\n\nContrary to expectations that personality differences have an effect on both speed and accuracy due to trade-offs ([@BIO033613C4]), the number of erroneous decisions during training was independent of how fast fish in a shoal reached a location together. However, shoals that made fewer erroneous collective decisions during training reached the learning criterion faster ([Fig.\u00a03](#BIO033613F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This negative association between erroneous trials and learning rate is consistent with learning by positive reinforcement, given less erroneous shoals would collectively reach the rewarded arm more frequently during training ([@BIO033613C2]), but suggests a low effect from negative reinforcement by the mild punishment of erroneous trials. Interestingly, the majority of shoals (eight/ten) re-oriented at probe trials to the location rewarded during training ([Fig.\u00a03](#BIO033613F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This indicates that most shoals did not simply use a learned response for collectively reaching the rewarded arm, e.g. turn direction, but learned the place of the reward. Place learning proposedly involves allocentric processes, where positions of distant cues in relation to a target are memorised and reorientation is possible ([@BIO033613C36]; Rodriguez et al., 1996). Although this may involve cognitive mapping (mental representations of space using the relative positions of landmarks), other cue-based strategies are difficult to exclude, e.g. beaconing to large cues near the goal ([@BIO033613C1]). Most notably, *D. rerio* zebrafish individuals can take longer to learn and do not prefer place over response learning ([@BIO033613C25]). Thus, being in a shoal can facilitate both learning efficiency and the use of learning strategies that rely on the memorisation of cues and not solely of simple directional responses. This has been exemplified recently in a study comparing shoals to individual zebrafish, where only shoals were able to exhibit place learning ([@BIO033613C26]). This is enabled in fish groups by social learning ([@BIO033613C21]; [@BIO033613C38]), cooperative vigilance and information sharing ([@BIO033613C31]; [@BIO033613C28]).\n\nIn contrast to models predicting that cohesion and individual differences in behaviour may affect collective behaviour and learning ([@BIO033613C7]), we found no strong evidence of personality or splitting having any significant influence on collective learning or accuracy. Decision accuracy and learning may instead be influenced by inter-individual differences in experience, attention, acquisition and cue perception ([@BIO033613C7]; [@BIO033613C18]). Indeed, in the absence of effects from individual behavioural phenotypes, based on personality, differences in individual experience and a balancing between personal and shared information in the group are both very likely alternative factors ([@BIO033613C29]). Otherwise, groups may rely on the leadership of more experienced or reward-driven individuals ([@BIO033613C11]; [@BIO033613C20]). For memorisation strategies in particular, there is evidence that individuals can use cue and response based strategies together and often animals reverse between strategies over training times ([@BIO033613C30]; [@BIO033613C3]). These processes could carry over in collective learning and this can be tested by repeated probe trials during collective training.\n\nAlthough our study did not include analysis of any kinematic data, recent work has increasingly shown the benefit of identifying behaviour-specific movement bouts ([@BIO033613C23]) and for assessing how the solitary movement patterns of group members affect collective swimming patterns ([@BIO033613C24]). This would provide more evidence for the individual effects on collective decisions and learning, and could identify the extent to which effects from individual motor behaviour are related to personality \\[e.g. bouts related to risk response or approach; [@BIO033613C23]\\] or other phenotypic factors, such as morphology ([@BIO033613C5]). While these effects remain to be examined, here we show that zebrafish can learn to reach collective spatial decisions for rewards and utilise place memorisation strategies to do this, but that collective decisions are biased by personality differences.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS {#s4}\n=====================\n\nAnimals and housing {#s4a}\n-------------------\n\nNa\u00efve adult male zebrafish *D. rerio* (*n*=50) were acquired from a local supplier, Grosvenor Tropicals, Lisburn, Northern Ireland. Given the supplier was not informed on strain variations in their stock, we used only males that show no strain preferences for shoaling ([@BIO033613C34]), which also removed the chance of mating during group living and controlled for sex-related differences in boldness. Fish were housed in tanks (26\u2005cm W\u00d736\u2005cm L\u00d730\u2005cm H; 26\u00b12\u00b0C and 7.4\u00b10.4\u2005pH dechlorinated tap water) enriched with fine sediment, plants and plastic pipes. Photoperiods were 12\u2005h long (0700--1900) and feeding was daily (TetraMin\u00ae flakes).\n\nBehavioural tests for boldness {#s4b}\n------------------------------\n\nFollowing a week-long acclimation to individual housing (tanks filled to 15\u2005L with view of neighbours to reduce isolation effects), the boldness of each fish was assessed in their housing tank by measuring consistency in their approach latency towards novelty between two contexts often used to test differences in boldness \\[see review by [@BIO033613C37]\\]. First, novel-object inspection was tested by the time fish took to reach \u223c1.5 body-length distance from a 7\u2005cm toy after it was lowered by a pulley system to the bottom of the tank, as estimated by viewing through a screen with a grid from above. Second, feeding motivation towards an unusual food was tested by recording the time fish needed to initiate feeding on chironomid larvae (released by forceps), which had not been previously offered to the fish in the laboratory. Opaque sheets visually separated each group from the others and shielded the observer during tests. Observations were made via a Sony HDR CX190E handycam video camera. Fish had not been fed for \u223c24\u2005h prior to testing. Both tests were 5\u2005min in duration, carried out at 11:00--13.00, with a 48\u2005h interval between them and in the same order for all fish to control for carry-over effects \\[see [@BIO033613C19]\\]. As would be expected for the expression of personality traits, like boldness ([@BIO033613C37]; [@BIO033613C42]), latencies were found to be consistent between contexts (Chronbach\\'s *\u03b1*=0.803; Pearson\\'s *r*=0.844) and used to calculate composite boldness scores. Greater latencies are linked to lower boldness ([@BIO033613C37]), thus the standardised sums of latencies from both tests were used as scores (z-values) and inversed in sign (positive or negative) to rank by increasing boldness ([Fig.\u00a01](#BIO033613F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nCollective tests for learning {#s4c}\n-----------------------------\n\nFollowing individual behavioural tests, fish were randomly sorted in shoals of five (*n*=10) and housed together (tanks filled to 25\u2005L) for a further week and then trained in a plus maze (four-arm maze constructed from acrylic sheets; each arm measuring 15\u2005cm W\u00d730\u2005cm L). During training internal landmarks were unavailable, but visual cues were available outside the maze, including white paper sheets on a distant wall, adjacent tank tops and the camera arm above the tank. To control for inter-shoal differences by differing information, these external cues and their locations were kept constant during trials and for all shoals. Shoal trials started in the bottom arm and the top arm was blocked during training. Trials commenced by removing an opaque divider that kept shoals constrained in the starting arm for 2\u2005min. Shoals were then presented with the two remaining arms, left or right, with 5\u2005min to choose between them. A collective decision was indicated by all individuals being in the same arm at the same time, training them to associate a collective decision towards one arm with a reward and towards the other arm with a mild punishment. The choice of direction, left or right arm, for the rewarded and mildly-punished arm was randomised across shoals. When reaching the arm randomly assigned to be food rewarded, shoals were blocked in until each fish received 1--2 chironomid larvae (individual feeding latency was \\<5\u2005s). However, in the unrewarded arm they were blocked in for 2\u2005min and not fed \\[mild punishment; [@BIO033613C25]; [@BIO033613C19]\\]. Following their choice, fish were gently guided by a net to the starting arm. After each trial, the tank water was disturbed to minimise use of olfactory cues. Shoals had ten such trials daily until reaching a learning criterion of a minimum of eight/ten correct trials (i.e. collectively choosing the rewarded arm) on three consecutive days. The learning criterion corresponds to a learning plateaux and success rates exceeding 24/30 correct trials, which differ from chance (15/30) at the 0.1% level. Shoals were given a single probe trial 24\u2005h after reaching the learning criterion, which started from the previously blocked top arm. This tested if fish were able to collectively reorient to the rewarded arm from a novel starting point, via the memorisation of the relative positions of the distal cues during training ([@BIO033613C32]). The probe trial was unrewarded to control for the use of olfactory cues.\n\nReaching the correct arm during probe trials showed the ability to reorient by using distal landmarks, i.e. place learning. By contrast, a failure to reach the goal arm in the probe trial was considered the result of learning to go left or right during training, i.e. response learning ([@BIO033613C25], [@BIO033613C26]). Collective decision speed, measured until the last fish of the group passed the mark to either arm (given all other fish were already in the same arm to designate a collective choice), was recorded only for the first training trial (novel task) and the probe trial (novel starting point). The choice of using decision times only from these two trials was because their novelty controlled possible effects of familiarity and experience of making a particular decision; decisions from other trials during training could be biased by reinforcement from previous trials and thus not representative of a novel decision. In addition, by measuring times at two relatively novel trials, where one was before and one after training, allowed us to examine if novel decisions are affected by the experience of training as a group. Comparisons before and after training further enabled us to test consistency in the effects of intra-group boldness on decision-making and to test for effects by individual-level learning. Before reaching collective decisions in these trials, some shoals exhibited splitting: individuals either stayed behind in the starting arm while others had chosen between left or right (rear fission) or went in a different direction, reaching the opposite arm from the rest (lateral fission) ([@BIO033613C9]). The distance needed to travel between arms (centre to centre) was \u223c27\u2005cm or five zebrafish body-lengths (4--6\u2005cm), and was thus considered sufficient to indicate splitting. We recorded the occurrence of any type of splitting as an inverse measure of cohesion. If fish reached an arm together within the 5\u2005min recording time, any splitting was noted and the collective decision was recorded as either correct (rewarded arm) or erroneous (unrewarded arm). Alternatively, if no choice was reached, any splitting was again recorded, but we did not count the trial as either correct or erroneous. Decision accuracy was measured by the total number of erroneous trials throughout training, because the number of correct trials can also be influenced by fish not choosing. The number of training days to reach criterion indicated learning rate.\n\nAnalysis {#s4d}\n--------\n\nCalculations, analyses and graphical representations were all carried out in the Minitab\u00ae statistics software (version 17; Minitab Inc., State College, USA). The proportion of shoals reorienting at the probe trial was first tested against chance levels (0.5) by a binomial-proportion test. Speed--accuracy trade-offs were tested by rank correlations between time to decide and the number of erroneous trials during training (Spearman\\'s *r~s~*) ([@BIO033613C4]). Decision times from initial and probe trials were found to be normally distributed. Comparisons between trials where any splitting occurred and trials where no splitting occurred was tested by Welch\\'s *t*-test, which does not assume equal variance and sample size. Individuals could not be identified during collective tests because the week-long group acclimation period prevented us from continuously tracking them, and methods of tagging were unavailable. As a result, we could not identify particular individuals with a known boldness score, but we could compare groups of differing composition in terms of individual member boldness. Therefore, regression models (linear for decision times, Poisson for number of days to learn and number of erroneous trials during training, and binary logistic for splitting probability) tested whether each measure was predicted by the mean (5% trimmed to limit bias by minority fish with extreme phenotypes) or the mean absolute deviation of shoal-member boldness (variance across all fish). Individuals with personality tendencies on the extreme ends of our distribution, mostly very shy individuals ([Fig.\u00a01](#BIO033613F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), can skew both the mean and variance, making it impossible to assess them as having a different effect, i.e. effects by the slowest individual would appear both in the mean and variance. However, by removing the extreme ends of the group (5% trimmed) we extracted mean values for shoals that represent the majority of their members and not biased by a single very timid fish. Conversely, the variance measure includes these extreme personalities. This enabled differentiation between effects by the majority average (trimmed mean) and the extremes (variance). Models testing decision speed and splitting additionally tested differences between initial and probe trial (categorical predictor; effect of learning) and included shoal number as a random effects term to avoid pseudoreplication. *Post-hoc* comparisons of consistency in splitting were carried out for boldness measures that were found related to splitting, using a one way ANOVA to test if shoals which had split in one, two or zero trials differed in boldness measures.\n\nEthical note {#s4e}\n------------\n\nAll applicable animal-welfare guidelines were followed (ASAB, 2016).

    "velop in patients ([@R14]).\n\nIncreasing rates of *C. difficile* infection in cases dispersed throughout our healthcare system prompted an examination of patient-associated risk factors for CDAD. We hypothesized that patients in whom CDAD was diagnosed were more likely to have received antibiotics of which use had increased over the past year and that differences in antimicrobial drug--prescribing patterns could account for the observed increase in cases.\n\nThe Study\n=========\n\nThe Veterans Affairs Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS) provides all medical services from intensive care to ambulatory and pharmacy services for approximately 36,000 veterans at four separate inpatient sites. A total of 778 beds are available for inpatient care, 120 of which are dedicated to acute medical and surgical care. Cases were defined as patients who were admitted to a VAMHCS institution from January 1, 2001, to June 30, 2001, who had a new onset of diarrhea documented in their medical records at least 72 hours after admission, a subsequent positive *C. difficile* toxin A enzyme immunoassay result (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, NJ), and no known history of CDAD. Patients with other reasons for diarrhea, such as laxative use, were excluded. The date of the positive *C. difficile* toxin test was considered to be the date of CDAD diagnosis.\n\nWe selected two controls per case from patients admitted to the VAMHCS institution for at least 48 hours during the same 6-month period as the case-patients. Controls were matched to the case-patients by unit of admission and length of time at risk for development of CDAD (defined below). We attempted to find two controls for each case with a time at risk within 5 days of that of the case. When finding such a control was not possible, we selected a control with the next closest length of time at risk. Controls had no known history of CDAD and did not receive oral metronidazole during their hospital stay in order to minimize misclassification of controls that might be cases.\n\nWe collected data by reviewing electronic medical records. Since antibiotic use up to 8 weeks before the CDAD diagnosis has been implicated as causing infection in previous studies ([@R1],[@R3]), we examined both inpatient and outpatient antibiotic use within the 6 weeks before diagnosis of CDAD for cases and for 6 weeks before hospital discharge for controls. Specific use of clindamycin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, and any other antibiotic drugs was recorded. The number of days that fluoroquinolones were administered to each patient was determined from medication orders and nursing notes. Length of time at risk for CDAD was defined as the number of days from admission to development of the illness for cases and the number of days from admission to discharge for controls. Demographic variables and details of hospital admission were also recorded, including the unit where CDAD was diagnosed (cases) or the admission unit (controls).\n\nWe compared characteristics of cases and controls with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Matched analysis of the association between individual variables and case or control status was performed by using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the odds of CDAD developing in a patient. Variables significantly associated with CDAD in our preliminary analysis were included in the multivariable regression model. Confounding was assessed by checking for a [\\>]{.ul}10% change in the coefficient estimate of covariates between models. A p value [\\<]{.ul}0.05 was considered significant; all statistical tests were two-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed by using SAS software version 8.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).\n\nThirty patients met the case definition during the study period; 60 controls were selected. The mean age of cases and controls was not significantly different ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). With the exception of one female control, all patients were male. Despite matching, case-patients had a longer length of time at risk for CDAD, but the difference between cases and controls was not statistically significant (p=0.18). Of both cases and controls, 20% were admitted to general medical units, 23% to general surgical units, 27% to subacute or long-term care, 17% to the medical intensive-care unit, and 13% to the surgical intensive-care unit.\n\n###### Characteristics of CDAD cases and matched controls, Veterans Affairs Maryland Health Care System, January 1, 2001--June 30, 2001\n\n  Characteristic                     Cases (n=30)^a^   Controls (n=60)^a^   p value\n  ---------------------------------- ----------------- -------------------- ---------\n  Age, median y                      72 (66--79)^b^    67 (56--76)^b^       0.30\n  Diagnosis causing admission                                               \n  Infectious                         11 (37)           11 (18)              0.07\n  Cardiovascular                     5 (17)            14 (23)              0.59\n  Neurologic/psychiatric             3 (10)            15 (25)              0.16\n  Gastroenterologic                  2 (7)             4 (7)                1.00\n  Respiratory                        1 (3)             5 (8)                0.66\n  Other                              8 (27)            11 (18)              0.42\n  Antibiotics within 6 weeks         30 (100)          38 (63)              \\<0.01\n  Cephalosporins                     7 (23)            20 (33)              0.30\n  Clindamycin                        9 (30)            7 (12)               0.03\n  Fluoroquinolones                   22 (73)           15 (25)              \\<0.01\n  Piperacillin/tazobactam            12 (40)           18 (30)              0.30\n  All other antibiotics              17 (57)           27 (45)              0.30\n  Days at risk for CDAD^c^, median   21(10--30)^b^     13(7--25)^a^         0.18\n\n^a^Unless otherwise indicated, values in parentheses show percentages.\u2028^b^Value in parentheses shows interquartile range.\u2028^c^CDAD, *Clostridium difficile*--associated diarrhea.\n\nAll 30 (100%) case-patients received antibiotics during the 6 weeks before their CDAD diagnosis.

Both clindamycin and fluoroquinolones were administered to a significantly higher proportion of cases than controls. For the patients who received fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin was prescribed most often for both cases (60%) and controls (60%), followed by ciprofloxacin (45% and 27%, respectively), and gatifloxacin (14% and 20%, respectively).

The results of the multivariable analysis are shown in [Table 3](#T3){ref-type=\"table\"}.

A group of bone marrow transplant patients who received ciprofloxacin monotherapy for prophylaxis against infection had no instances of CDAD, but two concurrent reports included cases of CDAD associated exclusively with ciprofloxacin ([@R9],[@R10],[@R15]). Another report implicated levofloxacin in eight of nine cases of CDAD in a nursing home ([@R11]). Fluoroquinolone use was also identified as an independent predictor of a positive *C. difficile* toxin assay in hospitalized patients ([@R16]). In addition, a case-control study of patients at an acute-care hospital identified ciprofloxacin use as a strong risk factor for nosocomial CDAD with an OR \\>5 in each regression model ([@R13]). Thus, our study is consistent with more recent reports that implicate fluoroquinolone use as a risk factor for CDAD.\n\nWe found that the association between fluoroquinolones and CDAD is stronger than the association between clindamycin and CDAD. However, the confidence intervals are wide because of the small sample size and overlap for the estimates, making a conclusion that fluoroquinolones are a stronger risk factor for CDAD than clindamycin inappropriate from our study. Because patients commonly receive more than one antibiotic, accurately measuring the effects of individual antibiotics in an observational study is difficult. Concurrent prescribing of clindamycin and fluoroquinolones may have biased the estimates of the OR; however, only 32% of patients who received fluoroquinolones also received clindamycin. In the case-control study of acute-care patients by Yip et al., ciprofloxacin was also a stronger risk factor than clindamycin ([@R13]).\n\nOur study has a number of limitations. Since the study was retrospective and we did not perform surveillance cultures for *C. difficile,* we could not ascertain when this organism was acquired; however, all cases received antibiotics before the diagnosis of CDAD. Thus, we conclude that fluoroquinolones are clearly associated with *C. difficile* infection. On the basis of our study design, we could not determine whether fluoroquinolones increase acquisition or promote infection once *C. difficile* is acquired. Although we did not specifically assess the role of patient-to-patient transmission in this study, we selected case-patients and controls from the same hospital units and with a similar risk period for developing the illness. Given the strength of the association between fluoroquinolone use and CDAD, more precise controlling for patient-to-patient transmission is unlikely to eliminate the association.\n\nIf fluoroquinolone use is a stronger contributing factor to *C.* *difficile* infection than other antibiotics, then restriction of fluoroquinolone use among inpatients would result in decreased CDAD rates. Climo et al. reported a decrease in the incidence of CDAD at their institution after implementing a formulary restriction of clindamycin ([@R17]). However, the decision to restrict fluoroquinolone use would need to be weighed against the clinical advantages of using fluoroquinolones, such as convenient dosing and excellent oral bioavailability (i.e., the ability of a drug to achieve high serum levels when taken by mouth). We observed a strong association between fluoroquinolone use and CDAD in both our acute-care and long-term--care patients, which supports a number of reports implicating fluoroquinolones in the development of CDAD ([@R6]--[@R11],[@R13]). A prospective study of this association is warranted, given the increasing use of fluoroquinolones and the excess complications and costs associated with *C. difficile* infection ([@R5]).\n\n*Suggested citation for this article:*McCusker ME, Harris AD, Perencevich E, Roghmann M-C.

If we could just learn to have positive emotions all the time we would manifest that into our lives in so many ways and find ourselves being happy all the time because we are manifesting good things into our lives.\n\nDon't blame the boss or the spouse or the kids for what is manifest in your life. It is an inside job and you have the power to turn things around anytime you wish.\n\nWhen we choose an intention we are setting what Don Juan Matus calls the \u201cinexplicable forces\u201d into work to bring that into manifestation in our lives. We don't control the inexplicable forces. We simply push the button on this huge machine that chugs and churns out what we wish to manifest, in its own way. So when we choose an intention, we set into motion the wheels that will manifest that intention in whatever way the machine brings it to us. The inexplicable forces set into motion the circumstances and situations in your life to manifest that intent. It may be that people come into your life or leave your life. It may be that the conditions to move or change jobs are set into motion. If your intention is to learn patience, then situations and conditions that will teach you patience will come into your life. You may find yourself waiting, waiting, and waiting in all kinds of situations because you asked to learn patience.\n\nThe students in this course have pushed the button on the machine to learn about the powers of the Shaman and the tools of shamanism and so it is. The machine is cranking out the situations and conditions and experiences into your life to let you experience these things. Many of you have now found that you can indeed meet with your guides. Something you never intended before but now you have. You may have found that now you can access your inner senses much more easily because that is your intention now where it was never your intention before. You may find balance and peace in your lives now because you have intended to find balance in your lives, where you never intended this before. Those of you who have an emotional feeling about this course, a desire to learn this, an excitement to have this new experience in your lives are seeing these things become manifest in your lives faster and more beautifully than those students who are just reading the course but not intending to experience this for themselves.\n\nHealing also works in the same way. Everything works in the same way. It is easy and always works. Those who have a positive emotional feeling about healing are pushing the button on that machine, setting those inexplicable forces into motion that will manifest healing in their lives. They have a positive anticipatory emotion about getting well. They are excited and really want to get well and by gosh they do get well! But those who are frightened, worried, fretting, or those who find some benefit in staying ill do not have this emotional gas in their car, this positive emotional feeling and so they are not getting well, at least not very fast because they don\u2019t' have any gas in their car. They may think they are setting an intention, pushing the button on the machine, but they don't have the emotional feeling to get well in truth so no button is being pushed.\n\nWe push the button on this machine without even realizing we are doing it. We see something we desire and we have an emotional feeling about that desire and guess what? We just pushed the button on the machine. Suddenly the forces are at work bringing the conditions, circumstances, situations into our lives to attain that desire. How they are developed is out of our control. But now our lives have changed and we have this new set of circumstances or conditions that bring that desire into our lives. Did you really desire that thing or were you just desiring something that wasn't really what you wanted, or good for you? But now here it is!\n\nMany people have many desires. I want this and this and that and not that. Each one is pushing the button of the machine. I want is an emotional feeling. But in truth they didn't really want it, or didn't want it enough, or were not committed to having that thing but yet the machine is at work manifesting that condition situation or circumstance into their lives and soon they feel overwhelmed with situations they must experience now, situations they don't like.\n\nWhen we commit to an intention we are agreeing to get that intention in whatever way the inexplicable forces bring it to us. The machine will bring just what you intend. But it will bring it in its own way according to the universal laws, according to what is around you and what energies are in this world. We spin the wheel and we get what we intend. We just don't control in what way we get it. So when you choose an intent you are agreeing to accept the manifestation of that intent in whatever way it is possible considering the conditions and energies around you at that time. You are responsible for your choices. You are agreeing to take the manifestation however it can be manifested at that time. (Hint: There is a time to push the button and a time not to push it!)\n\nSometimes the energies and conditions are better than others for manifesting your intent. It\u2019s much easier for the machine to manifest riches if you are in a position where riches are part of your belief system. Where having money is something you are comfortable with and can easily handle. A condition where having money is not seen by you as some kind of burden. \u201cOh, now I have to pay taxes on this money! Oh, now my relatives will all be knocking on my door trying to get loans from me. Oh, now the family will bug me to move to a nicer place. \u201c You see what kinds of emotions these thoughts are producing in you? Do you think that the machine will find the conditions and energies available to produce riches in your life in an easy way? Or will these thoughts produce negative energies and possibly some limits to the manifestation of the desire for riches?\n\nLets take another example. Lets say you wish to manifest peace in your life. So you feel positive about having peace in your life and you push the button on the machine and then you begin to notice that nothing around you is peaceful at all. The conditions have now begun to clear away any situations in your life that are not peaceful so that you can have peace. Yes the machine points out the weeds in your own life that are restricting you from having peace. The machine cuts the grass around your spiritual home and you can see where is good grass and where there are weeds. Now all you need to do to pluck out the weeds and you can have a nice grassy lawn. That is what you asked for. That is what you intended. Peace.\n\nSo all the situations in your life that are not peaceful are clearly shoved in your face to get rid of. See what I mean by, we push the button but how that intention is manifest is not up to us? Peace could also come to you by throwing you in a hospital for two weeks. Guess what? You have peace because no one is bugging you there. Peace could also come to you because a friend suddenly walks out of your life; a friend who didn't know peace and didn't encourage peace in your life. Suddenly boom, that friend is now gone and you have what you intended. Peace.\n\nDid you get it the way you wanted to? Perhaps not. Maybe now you are upset because you lost this unpeaceful friend. Maybe what you really wanted was this friend and not peace in your life. Can you change your mind now? Well maybe yes and maybe no. But the real question is, why did you intend peace when you really didn't want it?\n\nSo my point is to be sure that what you are intending is what you really want. You are going to get it. You are not going to control how you get it. So you better really want it under any circumstance no matter what.\n\nAnd remember too that even a passing thought can be an intention if it has the gas of emotion behind it. Some people go through their day thinking,\" Oh, if only I didn't have to go to work today\". They push the button and then they can't start their car. They call work and say they cannot come in. This makes them feel bad and embarrassed and limited. So they call the car repair and go through all the work to take the car to the repair shop and they feel miserable and they think, \"Man I hate that job so much! They make me feel so bad whenever I can't make it work. This is not my fault! I hate that job anyway.\" And now the machine is at work making you lose your job. So you finally get home and think, \" Well I have the day off now and I can get a lot of things done around the house. Yes that will be good!\" And the machine brings all the things you have to do at home into manifestation for you and you are suddenly working like a dog trying to get things done at home. And you think \"Boy, I wish my spouse and kids would pick up after themselves so I didn't have to do all this work. Why are they such piggys!\u201d And you push the button on the manifestation machine. And the kids come home from school and you are already angry with them and you shout at them and they are disobedient and unruly. And your spouse comes home and gruffly says, \"Where\u2019s dinner?\" and you just blow up at your spouse. The family eats take out.\n\nYou see how this person created this day for himself or herself?\n\nHow do you create your day? How important is it to choose your thoughts deliberately? How important is it to realize that even what you think can push the buttons on this inexplicable force machine and manifest your thoughts into your day?\n\nLets see an example of a longer-range intention.\n\nSo you want a better job. You have the emotion behind this intention. Suddenly your job becomes harder for you. You have pushed the button to remove you from that job you are in. You find you no longer like this job even more than before. The people at work are acting differently. The job load increases. Well of course, because you have pushed the button to get a better job. Pretty soon you quit this job because it has become intolerable and you are looking in the want ads for another job. But there is nothing there you want. Or nothing there that suits you. You go to interviews but no one hires you. Why? Because you are intending a specific job. You are trying to control how the machine manifests your intention. But we cannot control how the machine manifests our intentions. Or maybe you really don\u2019t want to work at all. If that is your intention then of course you are not going to find another job. Maybe you have negative feelings about working. Maybe you only want a certain kind of job. Maybe you don't want to drive so far to that job or do that kind of work that the machine has manifested for you. Oh, now you don't want what you have manifested. This happens all the time. We don't want what the machine has manifested. We don't want what we originally intended when we pushed that button. Whose fault is that?\n\nSo make sure that you really do want what you say you want. This is why we cannot allow our emotional bodies to run our lives. This is why we have to the captain of our own ship and not live according to \"how does this make me feel\". If we live that way we are just pushing the button on the machine all willy nilly as our emotions sway to and fro all the time and we are manifesting all kinds of things that we had feeling for one minute and don't have feeling for in the next moment. Yet they all become manifest in our lives. What a mess! And we wind up with the situations and conditions in our lives to fulfill our emotional desires of yesterday or last week but we don\u2019t' feel that way now. Yet the manifestation is here and we now get to deal with what our emotions chose to manifest last week. Yuk!\n\nSo choose deliberately. Choose wisely. Realize that what you want is going to manifest in your life. And how it manifests is not up to you. All the chaos and difficulty in your life today is the result of what you chose to manifest at some point in your life. And most likely is the manifestation of an emotional desire, not a well thought out deliberate choice on your part.\n\nWe are in control here. You have the power to manifest anything in your life that does not go outside the energies and conditions that surround your life today. If you believed that you could just pack up and go live in Hawaii, you could do that. How that would manifest however is not in your control. You would have to be willing to work with the inexplicable forces and go along for the ride in any way to achieve that manifestation. It might mean moving away from people you care about, from the schools your kids love, from the money and income and job you are used to doing. Are you willing to do this? If not, then don't intend this for yourself.\n\nSometimes the ways that the inexplicable forces manifest your intentions are so foreign to your way of life that you don\u2019t' even perceive that your manifested intention is right in front of you. Your desires for the status quo prevent you from seeing that the machine has produced that manifestation because you don't really want that manifestation. So now you have not moved to Hawaii because the real conditions of moving away from the life you are familiar with, used to, are just out of your desire to perceive that manifestation. This is to intend something that you would never really want.\n\nYet the conditions and situations for that manifestation are all around you. Perhaps your friends are moving away form you. Maybe your family has an air of unhappiness that you cannot explain. Maybe your job is no longer a happy one. Maybe there are other problems and issues in your life now. But even though you put out the intention to move to Hawaii you have long forgotten about that intention and never really meant you would really want to move to Hawaii. You just wanted a vacation. But you pushed the button to move to Hawaii. And now you have loads of problems in your life and don\u2019t know why. At this point you can always choose again. You can choose a new intention deliberately and find the words to phrase it simply and directly. That you want a happy life right where you are.\n\nBe careful with what you think. Don't let your mental body run your life because your emotional body is going to go through the ringer. Don't let your emotional body run your life because you are going to find things manifesting that you no longer really want. You be the captain of your ship. That eternal you, that higher self you, is the captain of the four bodies. Choose things that benefit your spiritual self, your eternal self and understand that you are going to experience the manifestation of your intentions however they are manifested.\n\nSometimes it is better to intend nothing and just let life carry you along like the beautiful river it is. Experience life each day as an adventure and gain all you can from the adventure. See all you can. Perceive all you can, Take it all in and be glad for the ride. You are here to experience life, after all.\n\nAnd if you are really, really brave you can intend what Creator intends for you. You can push the button on the machine to manifest what Creator wishes to manifest in your life. Again you cannot control how that will manifest. But it will be for your highest good. It may certainly not manifest into what you want for yourself. In fact, I can guarantee you that it will not be what you want for yourself emotionally or mentally or materially. And it may not seem easier or happier or richer and will not have more material things in store for you. It takes courage to align your intentions with Creators intentions for your life.\n\nIt takes a brave warrior who is wiling to go in whatever way Creator intends for them to go, if it means a new job or a more menial job or less money or a poorer neighborhood, or to let go of so many things you have worked hard on your own to attain, it might not be what you really want for you. So you have to think about this.\n\nCreator is going to put you where you can do the most good in this world. Creator is going to put a Light in a dark place. So you can count on becoming that Light and being that Light in a dark place if you align your intentions with Creator. Are you brave enough to do this? Are you willing to give up what you desire for yourself, what makes you happy in your own ego, and choose to push the button to bring into your life what Creator intends for you? You can\u2019t control how this will happen. So don't push the button for this until you are committed to living your life this way. It will completely change your life. It will bring you the spiritual gifts but it will also take away the material pleasures.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with material pleasures. Creator does not insist that you align with Creator\u2019s intentions. Creator gives you free will to create whatever you choose to create. My point here is that you are in the process of creating your own reality right now. You are pushing the button on the machine with your thoughts, desires, wishes and deliberate intentions, too. Be careful! It might be better to intend nothing at all.\n\nYou know the saying \u201cbe careful what you wish for, you might just get it?\u201d I guarantee you will get it. But are you deliberately choosing what you wish for? Or are you just getting hammered with the conditions and situations that you have manifested without even realizing that you have manifested them?\n\nShaman Elder Maggie Wahls Copyright 2008.

    "d from one route of cell differentiation to another, by inducing cells that differ from both the uninduced and induced states of the responding cells (inductions). Sometimes cells induce their neighbors to differentiate like themselves (homoiogenetic induction); in other cases a cell inhibits its neighbors from differentiating like itself. Cell interactions in early development may be sequential, such that an initial induction between two cell types leads to a progressive amplification of diversity. Moreover, inductive interactions occur not only in embryos, but in adult cells as well, and can act to establish and maintain morphogenetic patterns as well as induce differentiation (J. B. Gurdon (1992) Cell 68:185-199).\nPattern formation is the activity by which embryonic cells form ordered spatial arrangements of differentiated tissues. The physical complexity of higher organisms arises during embryogenesis through the interplay of cell-intrinsic lineage and cell-extrinsic signaling. Inductive interactions are essential to embryonic patterning in vertebrate development from the earliest establishment of the body plan, to the patterning of the organ systems, to the generation of diversive cell types during tissue differentiation (Davidson, E., (1990) Development 108: 365-389; Gurdon, J. B., (1992) Cell 68:185-199; Jessell, T. M. et al., (1992) Cell 68: 257-270). The effects of developmental cell interactions are varied. Typically, responding cells are diverted from one route of cell differentiation to another by inducing cells that differ from both the uninduced and induced states of the responding cells (inductions). Sometimes cells induce their neighbors to differentiate like themselves (homoiogenetic induction); in other cases a cell inhibits its neighbors from differentiating like itself. Cell interactions in early development may be sequential, such that an initial induction between two cell types leads to a progressive amplification of diversity. Moreover, inductive interactions occur not only in embryos, but in adult cells as well, and can act to establish and maintain morphogenetic patterns as well as induce differentiation (J. B. Gurdon (1992) Cell 68:185-199).\nThe origin of the nervous system in all vertebrates, for example, can be traced to the end of gastrulation. At this time, the ectoderm in the dorsal side of the embryo changes its fate from epidermal to neural. The newly formed neuroectoderm thickens to form a flattened structure called the neural plate which is characterized, in some vertebrates, by a central groove (neural groove) and thickened lateral edges (neural folds). At its early stages of differentiation, the neural plate already exhibits signs of regional differentiation along its anterior posterior (A-P) and mediolateral axis (M-L). The neural folds eventually fuse at the dorsal midline to form the neural tube which will differentiate into brain at its anterior end and spinal cord at its posterior end. Closure of the neural tube creates dorsal/ventral differences by virtue of previous mediolateral differentiation. Thus, at the end of neurulation, the neural tube has a clear anterior-posterior (A-P), dorsal ventral (D-V) and mediolateral (M-L) polarities (see, for example, Principles in Neural Science (3rd), eds. Kandel, Schwartz and Jessell, Elsevier Science Publishing Company: New York, 1991; and Developmental Biology (3rd), ed. S. F. Gilbert, Sinauer Associates: Sunderland Mass., 1991). Inductive interactions that define the fate of cells within the neural tube establish the initial pattern of the embryonic vertebrate nervous system. In the spinal cord, the identify cell types is controlled, in part, by signals from two midline cell groups, the notochord and floor plate, that induce neural plate cells to differentiate into floor plate, motor neurons, and other ventral neuronal types (van Straaten et al. (1988) Anal. Embryol. 177:317-324; Placzek et al. (1993) Development 117:205-218; Yamada et al. (1991) Cell 64:035-647; and Hatta et al. (1991) Nature 350:339-341). In addition, signals from the floor plate are responsible for the orientation and direction of commissural neuron outgrowth (Placzek, M. et al., (1990) Development 110: 19-30). Besides patterning the neural tube, the notochord and floorplate are also responsible for producing signals which control the patterning of the somites by inhibiting differentiation of dorsal somite derivatives in the ventral regions (BrandoSaberi, B. et al., (1993) Anat. Embryol. 188: 239-245; Porquie, O. et al., (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 90: 5242-5246).\nAnother important signaling center exists in the posterior mesechyme of developing limb buds, called the Zone of Polarizing Activity, or \"ZPA\". When tissue from the posterior region of the limb bud is grafted to the anterior border of a second limb bud, the resultant limb will develop with additional digits in a mirror-image sequence along the anteroposterior axis (Saunders and Gasseling, (1968) Epithelial-Mesenchymal Interaction, pp. 78-97). This finding has led to the model that the ZPA is responsible for normal anteroposterior patterning in the limb. The ZPA has been hypothesized to function by releasing a signal, termed a \"morphogen\", which forms a gradient across the early embryonic bud. According to this model, the fate of cells at different distances from the ZPA is determined by the local concentration of the morphogen, with specific thresholds of the morphogen inducing successive structures (Wolpert, (1969) Theor. Biol. 25:1-47). This is supported by the finding that the extent of digit duplication is proportional to the number of implanted ZPA cells (Tickle, (1981) Nature 254:199-202).",

    "fy that we represent the safety of each flight under our watch but work for the individual airline. We are a vital cog in the daily airline routine.\n\nWhat skills does one need to be a flight dispatcher?\n\nYou have to be a great multi-tasker and can\u2019t get rattled easily. As a Dispatcher you are expected to handle a multitude of situations, from the mundane to emergency situations. You have to be able to juggle those situations by prioritizing the most critical and time sensitive issues first. In addition, the Dispatch environment can be very stressful at times. So, you need patience and a good sense of humor to get through those difficult days. Every Dispatcher can recount some of their worst days on the job, but we keep coming back for more. We love our job and are some of the most passionate employees (and avgeeks!) in the business.\n\nI believe in the United States, a dispatcher and a captain have equal control over the flight. In practice, how does that work?\n\nThis is true, the Dispatcher and Captain are equally responsible for the safe conduct of the flight. These same regulations are also in place in Canada and a few other Countries. The concept is trained at all airlines that are required to use a Dispatcher. The Dispatcher and Captain each have to sign the Dispatch Release stating that it will be conducted safely. And, if something changes where there is a chance the flight might not be operated safely (weather en route, etc.), they will take appropriate steps to get the flight safely on the ground. The concept is called \u201coperational control.\u201d The flight will not be conducted unless the Dispatcher AND the Captain agree that it can be conducted safely. This rule is stated in the Federal Regulations and is a required part of the business. I believe Flight Crews have come to rely on Dispatch for the vast amount of information and resources we are able to provide.\n\nWhat else should we know about you or your job?\n\nEvery commercial flight operated in the United States that requires a Dispatcher has a person on the ground watching over them. We communicate constantly with flights to alert them to changing airport conditions as well as changing weather conditions. Our goal is to ensure every customer, Crew Member, or piece of cargo gets to where it is going safely and efficiently.Our livelihood is dependent on providing the highest level of safety and customer service to every flight and customer under our watch.

    "vices may increase. Then if they are clever their revenue will go up and everyone will forget this except M$.\n\nI'm with Yang...\n\nI'm certainly with Yang here.. It has not gone well for any company that Microsoft purchases. They're also a convicted monopolist, and by trying to buy up all Google's competitors (in search + web advertising at any rate) they are just trying to leverage this to take down Google and gain a monopoly in another market. If Microsoft wants to try to take over, fine, try to buy 50.1% of the stock.\n\nIf these investors do not like Yahoo's decisions, don't sue -- they haven't done anything to deflate the price (in fact it's risen ABOVE Microsoft's current offer), so there's not some big loss in stock value to sue over. If ya think Yahoo's fucked up and the stocks going to tumble, sell it now while it's high!\n\nYang's an idiot\n\nAnd everyone who's ever worked with him thinks so. He & Filo were simply standing at the right place at the right time in the early 90's, and that, not technical brains or business acumen, are why they are where they are today. The best thing for the owners of Yahoo (that's the shareholders for you idiots out there) is to get rid of Yang, Filo and the rest of the Yahoo board.\n\nnot up to Yang\n\nBackbone or not, its not up to him. Yahoo is a publicly traded company, not owned by Yang. if it was still his, he could do what he pleases for himself and who cares. But once it is in the public domain, the board has an obligation to the actual people who own the company - the shareholders - to do whats in THE SHAREHOLDERS best interest, regardless of personal bias.\n\nMines the one made of gold with bags of money tied to it, floating me gently down from the skies above San Francisco.\n\n@anon coward\n\nI'm not sure that the market is so fluid that if a pension fund decided to divest themselves of all of their holdings in a company, it wouldn't adversely affect the price of their sale.\n\nThat is, if YHOO is trading at $30, I can safely assume that I could buy or sell a share at $30. But a pension fund could hold hundreds of thousands of shares. You can't safely assume that if its trading at $30 then I can buy or sell hundreds of thousands of shares at that price. You have to find a buyer (or a seller).\n\nSold it there and then.\n\nSome people just think that going public with a company is some sort of funny way to get a load of free cash. But you're selling your company there and then, to the new stock holders. After that you're just there to make their investment grow, even if that means that you have to make a deal with some company you have a (strong) dislike for. If you can't take that, cash in your stocks and set up a new shop, or don't go public in the first place.\n\nThats what's capitalism is all about, you can't have the all the cash and all the power, sometimes you have to trade one for the other. If you want to have all the cash and all the power become a dictator and install communism.\n\nAs much as I am ambivalent about MS\n\nAnd as much as I resent MS monopolistic ways, their creating bloatware operating systems that require expensive hardware upgrades for most business and personal computer users, and their talent (not unusual for big companies) of conducting mergers that end up being less than the sum of the two parts, I have to side with Ballmer on this one. Yang has no plan to get Yahoo! to $40 a share on his own, or even sustain them at $30 if they are not considering an M&A play. Yang has no plan to compete strongly with Google. Yang has no plan to really leverage Yahoo!'s portal.\n\nYahoo!'s management needs to do the right thing for their shareholders. It's a shame that they can't make a go of it on their own, and I have no great love for MS, but if I was a Yahoo! shareholder I would be joining the lawsuit too. Yang and the Yahoo! board forgot their fiduciary duty to their investors.\n\nIf I were an investor in Yahoo!, I'd be friggin outraged!\n\nHey, if I paid 10 bucks a share for several thousand shares, you're damn right I'd want Yang to get every penny out of it, that he could. But, if his responsibilities were clouded by the fact that he was a part of \"creating\" yahoo, he should be tarred, feathered and thrown out the door.\n\nI don't give a damn if the buyer was microsoft, IBM, Google or Bob's vibrator repair, Yang has the professional responsibility to act in the best interest of the share holders.\n\nHe's negligent, in my opinion and should be heavily fined and or forced to pay some form of restitution to the bodies that were investing in Yahoo for the profit. Period.\n\nYang's a genius\n\nAnd everyone who's ever worked with him thinks so. He & Filo created the right place at the right time in the early 90's, and that due to technical brains and business acumen, is why they are where they are today. The best thing for the owners of Yahoo (that's the shareholders for the uninformed) is to richly reward Yang, Filo, and the rest of the Yahoo board.\n\nMy heart says...\n\n...shareholders be damned. You buy shares in my company, you buy shares in me, and I don't sell myself very easily. It's easy for people who've never started a business to say, \"Just sell it\" - I'll count their opinions when they sell their children.\n\nTypical Macro$lut...\n\nin their innovation by aquisition stratergy. They are only after Yahoo because their own search engine is such a pile of crap that no-one bothers with it.\n\nBut this time they ran up against a brick wall in that process. And so what they are now doing is getting some of their pet shareholders to buy Yahoo shares then bitch and moan about it in court, hoping that Yahoo will fold. It would be interesting to see how many of these shareholders were shareholders before, or even during, Macro$lut started their assimilation process.\n\n@Nordrick Framelhammer\n\nThat's how a publicly traded business works. Just in case you weren't aware.\n\nThe person/entity with the most shares get to make the decisions. If you buy the shares up (only possible because shareholders are willing to sell their stake) you win. Full Stop. If you weren't so busy hating MS you would be aware that this type of thing goes on everyday on Wall Street. Get your face out of the PC and look around a bit, it's actually quite nice out here.\n\nBest interest of shareholders or short term speculators? which one?\n\nI am always surprised when I see the phrase \"best interest of shareholders\" hijacked by short term speculators who don't care about the long term well being of the companies they \"invest\" in. Do they really invest in the company? The word \"invest\" shares a stem with the word \"vested\", it means you are entering into a vested interest. Speculators do not actually do that. They only invest in a short gain scenario, they sell out too soon to be considered to have a vested interest in the company at any point in time. They have an interest, yes, but not a vested interest.\n\nIf I look at the large mergers of the last decade, most of them have turned out to be disasters for the long term shareholders. They only ones to benefit from such mega-mergers or takeovers were the speculators, not the long term shareholders. Daimler-Benz lost 10 billion dollars on their adventure swallowing up Chrysler. For that amount of money they could have paid off all the speculators and still fare better as the burden of the merger would not have dragged them down. In the end they decided to get rid of Chrysler again. HP and Compaq is another such story. The combined value of the new company is less than what HP was worth before the merger. HP would likely be more profitable if they hadn't swallowed Compaq. Compaq itself was only up for grabs because they had swallowed DEC before and were unable to digest it.\n\nSo, who is to say that a MSFT-YAHOO merger would be a success in the long term. Speculators would make a killing that's for sure, but chances are that long term shareholders would lose out over the next 5-10 years. The IT industry is littered with mergers/acquisitions that destroyed the business of the acquired company and did not produce the expected and promised outcome for the acquiring company. At the same time, the consumer is worse off every time there is one competitor less. Ultimately those mergers erode the competitive landscape and that is not only bad for consumers but also for the competitors themselves.\n\nFor these reasons I seriously call into question whether Yahoo's refusal to merge with Microsoft really was against the interest of shareholders. It certainly was not in the interest of speculators. Other than that, this can only be satisfactorily judged a number of years down the road.\n\nGooglite alert\n\nYahoo! sucks and MS is desperate. Ballmer is a wild boar out of control. If they do eventually merge its simply: 2 pieces of shit = a larger piece of shit.\n\nI personally want MS to drop their Live! search rubbish. They are not a good search engine and never will be. They should simply use Google technology to search their own site. Using MS search to find anything useful on their own site turns up results that mean bugger all to anyone, its really really bad and pathetic.\n\nPut the resources saved from their Live! service into bringing out a decent OS that has some benefit to users over its predecessor.\n\nRe: not up to Yang\n\nYes it is. He's in charge.\n\nThe reasons for refusing could be so that THE COMPANY continues to exist and be profitable. That is ALL that the executives of a company have to do: ensure they remain profitable. Maximum profit isn't necessary. If you, as an investor, think that you could make more money investing in a more profitable company, sell your shares in Yahoo and buy this more profitable company. Don't drive the company to sell to a competitor just so that that competitor can close the company and make it have ZERO PROFIT just so you can offload your shares at a peak. That isn't profiting from the business, that's selling off assets.\n\nANYONE can make massive profits by selling off assets. However, you only have so many assets to sell, and you need assets to make profit, so your profit goes down as you sell assets.\n\nSurely if the CEO's job is to maintain profit, he should be able to tell shareholders to stuff it if the actions they want taken will reduce profitability. If not, then his job isn't \"maintain profitability\", is it, 'cos it can be countermanded by another.\n\nso he told m$ to piss off...so what?\n\nhe started the company and he doesn't want it to be controlled by M$, yes, his heart ruled, so bloody what? maybe more heart and soul is needed in the industry and not just cash grabbing faceless wonders, like mr gates for example.\n\nCorporations\n\nThis is the problem with business nowdays. The responsibility of the board and CEO IS to achieve maximum profitability (value) for the shareholders, not to simply remain profitable. It is an investment, and as an investor you want max return on your investment. If something can be done to increase return, then it must be done.\n\nI'm not saying I agree with this method, but that's also the reason I wouldn't build a publicly traded company. Private investors providing loans to a company is a different story, as long as you repay at the contracted rate, that's the only obligation you have. Your profitability or value from that point can be whatever you chose, as you have no responsibility of value. Public corporations DO have responsibility of value.",

To translate that into a call, just do this:\n$response = $soapClient->queryByPartyId(array('foobar'=> 123456));\nvar_dump($response);\n\nThe wsdl should also contain a description of what the service will return:\n<element name=\"queryByPartyIdResponse\">\n    <complexType>\n        <element name=\"PartyReturn\" type=\"xs:SomeType\" />\n    </complexType>\n</element>\n\nIn this example, the response will be an object (or whatever your soapclient returns) with 1 property: PartyReturn, that property will be of the type SomeType. If it's a custom type (a Java class) the wsdl file will contain a description of that, too.\nIn your case:\n$response = $soapClient->queryByPartyId(\n    array('queryByPartyIdInMsg' => array('PartyId' => 123456))\n);\n\nOr perhaps you'll need to wrap the queryByPartyIdInMsg sub arrays into another array, because both complexTypes have a minOccurs of 0 (suggesting an array)\n\n",
    "enal, bilateral, malignant, and familial cases each represented 10% of the total. A task force of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan established the diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Typical cases of pheochromocytoma are readily diagnosed based on high catecholamine levels and imaging of tumor localization and can be cured by surgical resection of the tumor. In contrast, since no effective treatment for malignant pheochromocytoma has been established, a combination of various treatments including the administration of a-blockers, 131-MIBG irradiation, and cisplatin/vinblastine/dacarbazine chemotherapy, and radiation of bone metastases is recommended. Careful long-term follow-up is essential even in patients with benign pheochromocytoma.",

    "ost\nbeautiful city in the world? It is not far from it. No urban night is like\nthe night there. . . . Squares after squares of flame, set up and cut into\nthe aether. Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our\nwill.Ezra Pound (1885-1972), U.S. poet,\ncritic. \"Patria Mia,\" in New Age (London, 18 Sept. 1912).\n\n1973 - Ethernet\n\nRobert Metcalfe devised the\nEthernet method of network\nconnection at the Xerox\nPalo Alto Research Center. He wrote: \"On May 22, 1973, using my Selectric\ntypewriter ... I wrote ... \"Ether Acquisition\" ... heavy with handwritten\nannotations -- one of which was \"ETHER!\" -- and with hand-drawn diagrams\n-- one of which showed `boosters' interconnecting branched cable, telephone,\nand ratio ethers in what we now call an internet....\nIf Ethernet was invented in any one memo, by any one person, or on any\none day, this was it.\"\n\n\"My wireless transmitter does\nnot use Hertzian waves, which are a grievous myth, but sound waves\nin the aether...\" -- Nikola\nTesla\n\nPeter Carroll, in discussing the theoretical\nunderpinnings of modern 'Chaosmagic',\nraises the concept of ether from its dusty grave in order to address the problem\nof instantaneous (faster-than-light) information\ntransmission. According to this view, ether is a dimension which is 'orthogonal'\nto that of time,\nor is 'a kind of shadow substance', wherein patterns of probability affect material\nevents. It must be pointed out that this is different to the classical concept\nof ether as a transmissive physical substance, which was postulated in order to\nexplain the propagation of light\nwaves through a vacuum. The Michaelson-Morley experiment in 1887 supposedly dismissed\nthe notion of ether's physical existence, paving the way for Einstein's special\ntheory of relativity (Zukav, 1978). For Carroll, although ether has a real\nexistence, it is not a physical substance, while still affecting physical events\nsimultaneously across space. This phenomenon is important to conceptions of magic,\nwhich have magicians causing things to occur across space and time without any\nphysical contact\nbetween their conjurations and the resulting phenomena.\n\nCarroll points out that his conception\nof ether is merely a model to explain existing phenomena, and should not be\nthought of as necessarily having an independent existence outside of this conception,\njust as physicists make models to explain events in physical interactions. According\nto the magical model, ether 'acts as though it were a form of information emitted\nby matter that is instantaneously available everywhere and has some power to\nshape the behaviour of other matter' (Carroll, p21). This vision of a fundamentally\ninterconnected, dynamic universe is in a sense a return to an ancient, Aristotelian\nvision of an organic, interconnected cosmos; it is also a concept of reality\nwhich is particularly apt in terms of chaos theory, with its fractal\nmaps of infinite\nspace.\n\n\"Ether, having once failed as a concept, is in the process\nof being reinvented. Information\nis the ultimate mediational ether\"\n\nRecapitulating, we may say that\naccording to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical\nqualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether. According\nto the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for\nin such space there not only would be no propagation of light,\nbut also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods\nand clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But\nthis ether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic\nof ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time.\nThe idea of motion may not be applied to it.\"\n\nFrom \"Ether and the Theory of Relativity\"\nan address delivered on May 5th, 1920, in the University of Leyden by Albert\nEinstein.\n\nA\nseventeenth century chemical sign for oil. Oil was also drawn , ,\nand in many other ways. Different types of oil also had their special\nsigns.\n\nThree golden circular forms is also an old\nsign for pawnbrokers and money-lenders.

Among the patients, four cases recovered completely after treatment, one was diagnosed as having aspiration pneumonia and the other died of severe bronchospasm. The occurrence of this complication was probably related to the mode of delivery by cesarean section, the underdevelopment of effective barrier for preventing GER-A at very early stage and the inadequate management of the newborn. It is suggested that the prevention and proper treatment of GER-A was important in lowering neonatal morbidity and mortality.",

    "rchitect Sverre Fehn and opened in 1974. The cathedral ruins are secured under a glass shelter  designed by Lund & Slaatto Architects and completed in 1998.\n\nMuseum attractions\nThere are several noteworthy aspects to the museum:\n\n Its medieval section includes the ruins of a cathedral as well as remnants of a bishop's priory. The cathedral was originally constructed of locally quarried limestone in Romanesque architecture, although later additions were of Gothic architecture.  The distinctive arches in the cathedral ruins are  covered by a steel and glass structure designed by Lund & Slaatto and undertaken by the Norwegian government. \nThe cathedral was never deconsecrated, and remains under the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church - weddings can only be performed there with the permission of the church. \n Its ethnological museum provides a good sense of how people in the region lived from about the 16th century until the early 20th century. It includes buildings and courtyards collected from across the Hedemarken region, many of which have been restored to their original appearance. Among other noteworthy buildings, the collection includes one of the finest 19th century residential homes from the area.\n It is an active archeological site, and visitors can see the state of the dig at any given time. Most of the medieval town is as yet unexcavated, and visitors can visit the site in a field outside the confines of the museum.\n Storhamarl\u00e5ven was designed by Sverre Fehn in concrete, wood and glass to contrast with the stone of the medieval ruins. It was originally a barn built  beside the ruins in the 17th century for the farm Storhamar. The architect sought to both highlight the original medieval structure and the more recent farm building. Its design won the Betongtavlen architectural award in 1976. Ramps provide the means to view the museum from above.\n It is located in a beautiful recreational area along Lake Mj\u00f8sa. The recreational area is open to the public and includes a swimming area, gravel walkways, grass lawns, and a long shoreline.\n\nReferences\n\nRelated reading\nWelle-Strand, Erling (1974) Museums in Norway (Oslo: Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs)  \nS\u00e6ther, Tor (1995)  Hamar i middelalderen (Hedmarksmuseet og Domkirkeodden)\n\nExternal links\n Anno Museum official website\n\nCategory:Culture in Hedmark\nCategory:History of Hedmark\nCategory:Museums in Hedmark\nCategory:Open-air museums in Norway\nCategory:Photography archives in Norway\nCategory:Buildings and structures in Hamar\nCategory:High-tech architecture\nCategory:Modernist architecture in Norway",

    "ents with AIDS and other immunosuppressed persons ([@R6]).\n\nNTM, particularly *M. avium* and *M. intracellulare*, have been recovered from a variety of environmental niches with which humans come in contact, especially drinking water ([@R14]*--*[@R19]). NTM are not transient contaminants of drinking water distribution systems; rather, the NTM grow and persist in plumbing ([@R19]*,*[@R20]). For example, numbers of mycobacteria increase in pipes as the distance from the treatment plant increases ([@R19]). NTM cell surface hydrophobicity results in disinfectant resistance and a predilection to attach to surfaces where NTM grow and form biofilms ([@R21]*,*[@R22]) that further increase disinfectant resistance ([@R23]). Because disinfectants inhibit the competing microflora, the slow-growing NTM can grow on the available nutrients in the absence of competition. *M. avium* can grow in drinking water at concentrations of assimilable organic carbon of \\>50 \u00b5g/L ([@R24]). Thus, there is strong reason to hypothesize that NTM can colonize and persist in household plumbing.\n\nSources of human infection with NTM, including MAC, have been found in water ([@R18]) and potting soil ([@R25]). Notably, *M. avium* was detected in water aboard the Russian space station Mir ([@R26]). Recently, researchers found that the DNA fingerprints of several *M. avium* isolates recovered from the shower of an *M. avium*--infected patient were almost identical to isolates recovered from the patient, indicating that the household water could have been the source of the patient's pulmonary disease ([@R27]). Despite that evidence, several publications have documented low frequency of recovery of MAC from household water samples ([@R17]*,*[@R28]*--*[@R30]). Such low recovery rates of *M. avium* and *M. intracellulare* could be because water samples, not biofilm, were collected. As MAC preferentially attaches to surfaces ([@R21]*--*[@R23]), MAC may be at low numbers in water samples. Furthermore, in the studies cited above, a low number ([\\<]{.ul}4) of samples were collected from individual households. Recovery of multiple NTM or MAC isolates is necessary because of the clonal variation of MAC ([@R25]*,*[@R27]). The pilot study described here isolated, enumerated, and DNA fingerprinted NTM from households of patients with NTM to test the hypothesis that household plumbing could be a source of their NTM infection.\n\nMethods\n=======\n\nPatients and NTM Isolates\n-------------------------\n\nNTM patients were recruited to participate in studies of their household water systems through the auspices of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Research and Information, Inc. Informed consent was obtained from each participating patient, and the study was reviewed by the Virginia Tech Institutional Research Board and granted exempt status. NTM isolates from the patients, if possible, were obtained through collaborating physicians and mycobacteriology laboratories. In some instances multiple patient isolates of different species were found. A questionnaire was provided to each patient to obtain information about the household plumbing.\n\nHousehold Water and Biofilm Samples\n-----------------------------------\n\nSterile containers and swabs were sent to each collaborating patient household. Directions for collection of hot and cold water samples (500 mL) and biofilms/sediment from water taps and showerheads by using swabs were provided. If the patient thought that infection might have occurred as a result of exposure to soil, soil samples were collected. In some cases filters (fiber, activated charcoal, and reverse osmosis) were collected. All samples were returned at ambient temperatures by express courier service to the Mycobacteriology Laboratory in the Department of Biological Sciences at Virginia Tech.\n\nIsolation and Identification of Mycobacteria\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMycobacteria in water and swab (taps and filters) samples were counted and isolated as described ([@R27]). Soil samples were processed as described ([@R25]). Most acid-fast colonies picked for identification and enumeration were small (1-mm diameter after 14 days at 37\u00b0C), unpigmented to yellow, and resembled either the transparent or opaque types previously reported ([@R17]). Acid-fast isolates were identified by nested PCR of the 16S rRNA gene ([@R31]) and PCR amplification and analysis of restriction endonuclease digestion fragments of the heat-shock protein 65 (*hsp65*) gene ([@R32]).\n\nFingerprinting Patient and Environmental Isolates\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn those instances in which the *Mycobacterium* species from the patient and household water system isolates were the same, isolates were fingerprinted by repetitive sequence-based PCR (*rep*-PCR) ([@R33]). Matches were confirmed by use of GelCompar II software (Applied Maths, Inc., Austin, TX, USA).\n\nResults\n=======\n\nHousehold Plumbing Samples\n--------------------------\n\nSamples for NTM isolation were received from 31 collaborating patients throughout the United States and Canada: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin, USA; and Ontario, Canada. Six patients each had 2 residences and sent samples from each residence.\n\nNTM Isolation\n-------------\n\nThe isolates from the 31 patients with NTM infection included *M. avium* (9), *M. intracellulare* (6), MAC (11), *M. abscessus* (4), and *M. xenopi* (1). Isolates could not be obtained from 11 patients, thus preventing *rep*-PCR fingerprinting even in those instances where household isolates belonged to the same species. Thus, the total number of patient isolates available for fingerprinting was only 20. All putative *Mycobacterium* spp. isolates recovered from samples were identified, and 45% of NTM-positive households (10/22) and 1.5% of NTM-positive samples (6/394) yielded \\>1 NTM species ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). The average number of different NTM species per household was 1.9 (range 1--5 NTM species/household). In those instances where the *Mycobacterium* species of the patient and their household plumbing isolates were the same (e.g., *M. avium*), all isolates belonging to the same species as the patient were subject to *rep*-PCR fingerprinting. Household isolates included *M. avium* (10), *M. intracellulare* (10), *M. malmoense* (5), *M. szulgai* (3), *M. chelonae* (2), *M. gordonae* (6), and 1 each of *M. scrofulaceum*, *M. terrae*, and *M. trivale* ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). Samples were coded with the first 2 or 3 letters representing each patient, a letter representing sample type (W, water; Sw, swab \\[biofilm\\]; S, soil), a number for sample number from a household collection, and the final number for the isolate from the sample; thus, ML-W-6-2 is the second water isolate from the sixth sample collected from patient ML's household.\n\n###### Characteristics of NTM isolated from samples from household plumbing of patients with NTM infection, 2007--2009\\*\n\n  Characteristic                                     Value\n  -------------------------------------------------- --------------\n  No. households sampled                             37\u2020\n  Households with NTM                                22/37 (59)\n  Households with \\>1 NTM species                    10/22 (45)\n  Total no. samples collected                        394\n  Samples with NTM                                   109/394 (28)\n  Samples with \\>1 NTM species                       6/394 (1.5)\n  Households with NTM of same species as patient     17/37 (46)\n  Household and patient NTM share same fingerprint   7/17 (41)\n\n\\* Values are no. positive results/no. samples in category (%) except as indicated.

There was a positive correlation between the number of samples collected per household and the number of NTM-positive samples (r\u00a0=\u00a00.4581). In 8 households \\>50% of the samples yielded NTM, and in 7 households no NTM were isolated. Seventeen of the 37 household sample collections had at least 1 sample that yielded an NTM isolate that belonged to the same species as that of the patient. Among those 17 households, at least 1 NTM isolate from 7 households exhibited the same *rep*-PCR fingerprint as that of the patient. Specifically, the [Figure](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}illustrates matching *rep*-PCR band patterns of patient isolate ML-P-1 (lane 3) and shower water isolate ML-W-6-2 (lane 4) from the patient's home and patient isolate TC-P-1 (lane 10) and tap water isolate TC-W-2-2 (lane 12) from the patient's home. Matches were confirmed by use of GelCompar II software (Applied Maths, Inc.). Furthermore, the [Figure](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}also illustrates the relative similarity in *rep*-PCR band patterns of patients and their household isolates and the wide differences between isolates of different patients (compare lanes 3--4, lanes 7--8, and lanes 10--12). On the basis of diversity of band patterns and the number of bands (7--14 bands), the results confirm the discriminatory power of *rep*-PCR fingerprinting ([@R32]). The percentage of fingerprint matches may be an underestimate because patient isolates could not be obtained for 11/31 patients, all of whom had MAC infections.\n\n![Repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprint patterns of nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from patients and household plumbing.

The highest numbers of NTM, as CFUs, were recovered from biofilms (10,371 CFU/cm^2^), with lower numbers from filters (1,987 CFU/cm^2^), soils (1,500 CFU/g), and water (157 CFU/mL). Most biofilm samples were collected by swabbing either the inside of a water tap or showerhead with a sterile swab that was immediately placed in 2 mL sterile tap water. Because the samples were shipped immediately after collection, there was little opportunity for the NTM numbers to change.\n\nHousehold Plumbing Characteristics as Determinants of NTM Presence\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview of the responses to the NTM patient questionnaire led to identification of 2 factors that seemed to influence NTM in household samples. Households with water heater temperatures [\\<]{.ul}125\u00b0C (50\u00b0C) were more likely to yield NTM (17/20, 85%) compared with households in which water temperature was [\\>]{.ul}130\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) (6/15, 40%) ([Table 2](#T2){ref-type=\"table\"}). That difference was significant (p = 0.0107; relative risk\u00a02.125, by Fisher exact test). Although households with water from a public or private water system were more likely to have NTM (19/27, 70%) compared with households with water from a well (5/12, 42%) that difference was not significant (p = 0.1532; relative risk\u00a01.689 by Fisher exact test) ([Table 3](#T3){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n###### Influence of water heater temperature on presence of NTM in samples from household plumbing of patients with NTM infection, 2007--2009\\*\n\n  Characteristic                   No. households        \n  -------------------------------- ---------------- ---- ----\n  Water heater temperature                               \n  [\\<]{.ul}125\u00b0F ([\\<]{.ul}50\u00b0C)   17               3    20\n  [\\>]{.ul}130\u00b0F ([\\>]{.ul}55\u00b0C)   6                9    15\n  Total no. households             23               12   35\n\n\\*NTM, nontuberculous mycobacteria.\n\n###### Influence of water source on presence of NTM in samples from household plumbing of patients with NTM infection, 2007--2009\\*\n\n  Characteristic            No. households        \n  ------------------------- ---------------- ---- ----\n  Water source                                    \n  Public or private piped   19               8    27\n  Well                      5                7    12\n  Total no. households      24               15   39\n\n\\*Two households received water from a piped system and a well. NTM, nontuberculous mycobacteria.\n\nDiscussion\n==========\n\nThe data document the relevance of household water as a source of NTM infection. Seven (41%) of the 17 patients from whom isolates were obtained were infected with an NTM strain having the same DNA fingerprint as at least 1 NTM isolate from their household plumbing. Several characteristics of household water and plumbing are conducive to NTM survival and growth. Specifically, residual disinfectant selects for disinfectant-resistant NTM ([@R23]), pipe surfaces offer opportunities for biofilm formation ([@R21]*--*[@R23]), and low organic matter content permits growth of the oligotrophic NTM ([@R22]*,*[@R24]).\n\nThe frequency of samples yielding NTM (28%) reported is almost identical to the frequency of *Mycobacterium* spp. 16S rRNA sequences in biofilm (swab) samples collected from showers across the United States ([@R34]). In as much as that culture-independent study ([@R34]) did not collect samples specifically from households of NTM patients, apparently NTM are quite frequent in household water and plumbing across the United States and Canada and are not unique to household plumbing of NTM patients. In addition to exposure, host factors ([@R6]*--*[@R10]) are influential factors in the acquisition of NTM disease. For the study reported here, NTM patient contamination of samples was unlikely because the patients were either free of NTM in sputum or were continuing antimycobacteria therapy; none were persistently sputum positive. The low frequency of recovery of NTM by other studies ([@R17]*,*[@R28]*--*[@R30]) was likely because a low number of samples were collected from households. As shown here, only 28% of household samples yielded NTM, and there was a positive correlation between the number of samples collected and the recovery of NTM from household samples.\n\nIn addition to documenting the presence of NTM in households across the United States, the data from this pilot study with its relatively small sample size suggest that water heater temperature and water source could be factors influencing NTM presence. NTM were less frequently recovered from household samples whose water heater temperature was [\\>]{.ul}130\u00b0C ([\\>]{.ul}55\u00b0C). The relative risk of NTM presence was 2.125 for households whose water heater temperature was [\\<]{.ul}125\u00b0C ([\\<]{.ul}50\u00b0C). In fact, 6 of the 7 households whose patient and plumbing isolates shared identical *rep*-PCR patterns had water heater temperatures [\\<]{.ul}125\u00b0C ([\\<]{.ul}50\u00b0C). That association correlates with the temperature sensitivity of NTM species. For example, the time required to kill 90% of *M. avium* cells is 1,000 min at 50\u00b0C but only 54 min at 55\u00b0C; similar times were measured for *M. intracellulare* ([@R35]). High water heater temperatures have been associated with low numbers of *Legionella* spp. in household and other building plumbing ([@R36]*--*[@R39]).\n\nIt would follow that persons infected or at risk for NTM disease, e.g., slender elderly persons or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene heterozygotes ([@R8]--[@R13]), consider increasing water heater temperatures. Households whose water came from a public or private water system were more likely to have NTM in household water than those whose water source was a well (p = 0.1532, relative risk\u00a0=\u00a01.689). Although not significant, that result is consistent with the fact that NTM are seldom detected in groundwater ([@R40]). This pilot study will be followed by an investigation to assess the influence of a variety of household plumbing characteristics in households of additional NTM patients and their neighbors.\n\n*Suggested citation for this article*: Falkinham JO III.

    "e researches and implementations on organ donation are executed under the Law on Taking, Keeping, Implanting and Transplanting Organs and Tissues enacted in 1979. According to this law, organs can be taken from dead people including newborns to those aged 60 years, and everybody who is over 18 or sane can donate their organs \\[[@ref3]\\].\n\nIn Turkey, the organs to be transplanted are generally provided from close relatives of the patient. Similar to Asian and Middle Eastern countries, cadaver organs haven't been donated in sufficient amounts in Turkey and this leads to widening of the gap between the need and procurement of transplantable organs. While approximately 75% of organ transplantations are performed with the organs taken from healthy people in Turkey, more than 80% of the transplantations are performed with the organs taken from cadavers in European countries. Organ donations are evaluated according to cadaver donors per one-million populations. While organ donation from cadavers is 20-30 per one million in developed countries, it is 33.6 in Spain, 25.2 in Belgium, 14.1 in Canada, 16.2 in France, 4.5 in Greece, and 2 per million in our country \\[[@ref5]\\]. The most important reason for this is that the society remains insensitive against organ donation. Various studies have obtained the views of people about organ transplantation and showed that academic, and cultural background, socioeconomical level, and religious beliefs are significant factors \\[[@ref6]\\]. In order to increase the frequency of organ donation, knowledge level of the community on this issue should be raised, negative attitudes of the society should be eliminated, and obstacles against organ donation should be overcome. To this end, health personnel and all sections of the society, especially trained ones, should have sufficient knowledge and consciousness \\[[@ref3], [@ref7], [@ref8]\\].\n\nThis study aims to determine knowledge levels and attitudes about organ donation and transplantation among third-grade university students in different faculties of a university.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS {#sec1-2}\n=====================\n\nThis descriptive research was performed in December 2004, with third-grade students in faculties of medicine, pharmacy and law of a university. Any randomized sampling was not done, and the participants were asked to fill the questionnaire forms under surveillance before their classes on a determined day. A total of 150 third-grade students in the faculties of medicine, pharmacy and law were surveyed, and the study was performed with 145 students (96.6%) who had accepted to participate in the research. During the survey, a questionnaire form composed of 19 questions and prepared by the researchers was used. This questionnaire form was composed of the questions about socio-demographic characteristics, and knowledge levels and attitudes of the participants about organ transplantation. Approval from the local ethics committee, and necessary permits were obtained from dean's offices of the relevant faculties. Furthermore, the participants were informed about the purpose of the research, and its performers. They were assured about the confidentiality of their personal information, and that their approvals were obtained. The data was evaluated using descriptive statistics in SPSS statistics program.\n\nRESULTS {#sec1-3}\n=======\n\nStudy population consisted of 145 participants (female, 66.2%, and male 53.8%). Students were from faculties of law (31.7%) medicine (33.1%), pharmacy (35.2%) A total of 4.1% of the students had a relative who had undergone or had been waiting for organ transplantation, and 9.0% of them had a relative to whom an organ had been donated.

The responders indicated kidney (95.9%), bone marrow (91.0%), cornea (89.0%), liver (75.9%), heart (75.1%), gall bladder (6.2%), and brain (3.4%) as transplantable organs. The students indicated that they had obtained their knowledge about organ transplantation from television/radio (81.3%), newspaper/journals (79.3%), their environment and friends (28.2%), books (21.4%), and internet (15.2%).\n\nMost (71.7%) of the participants stated that they had favourable views about the idea of organ transplantation after death. Half of 104 students emphasized their fovourable views because by donating their organs they would be very helpful for others, and they also stated that in addition to being helpful, they won't need these organs after death (11.6%). Other reasons for their favourable views included no more need of their body after death (5.8%), acquiring merit in God's sight (30.7%), while 30.7% gave no reason for their positive views. While 83.7% of the participants with positive views stated that they wished to donate all of their transplantable organs, and 16.3% of them wished to donate some of their organs. Only 20.2% of the students stated that they should apply to hospitals and health organizations for organ donation. Only 3.8% (n=4) of the students with positive views about organ transplantation had a certificate showing that they had donated their organs, and only one of them was always carrying this certificate with him/her. The other 2 students stated that their families weren't aware of their decisions. While, 17.1% of 41 students with negative views about organ transplantation indicated that their body integrity would be impaired. Some of them (9.8%) deemed organ donation to be against their religious beliefs or they thought that it would be a sinful act (4.9%) or they would get hurt (2.4%). While 65.8% of them gave no reason for their negative views. A little less than half (44.1%) of the participants had positive views about donating organs of their relatives after their death. A total of 64 students had positive views about organ transplantation because by donating their organs they would be very helpful for others (57.8%), and also they stated that in addition to being helpful, they won't need these organs after death (7.8%). Other reasons for their favourable views included no more need of their body after death (5.8%), acquiring merit in God's sight (30.7%), while 30.7% gave no reason for their positive views. A total of 64 students had positive views about organ transplantation because they wanted to help others in need of transplants (57.8%), and they didn't need their bodies after death (7.8%). Acquiring merit in God's sight (1.5%) was another rationale. While 24.7% of them gave no reason for their positive views. Majority (67.9%) of 81 students with negative views responded that right to decide didn't belong to them, that they would commit a sin (3.7%), that their body integrity would be impaired (2.5%) and that it wasn't true religiously (1.2%) while 24.7% of them gave no reason for their negative views. More than half (51.7%) of the participants had positive views about transplantation of organs of a deprived person to another one after death. Moreover, 84.1% of the patients stated that they should make their own decisions about organ transplantation before death, While others responded that their family (31.0%) or their physicians (8.2%) should make decision for organ donation after their death.

In investigations performed with the students of several medical faculties in Turkey, cadaver donors were stated as the most proper donors for organ transplantation \\[[@ref7], [@ref9]\\]. The result of our study is different from literature findings. The reason for this diversity may be that the students from the faculties other than medical faculties were also included in the research. While in European countries cadaveric, and living organ donors consist of 80%, and 20% of the transplantations performed, in Turkey organ donations are made mainly from living donors (cadaveric donors, 25% vs living donors, 75%). As an outcome of recent studies performed in our country, there has been an increase in the number of cadaveric donors \\[[@ref10], [@ref11]\\].\n\nIn our research, kidney was stated as the most transplantable organ (95.9%), followed by bone marrow, cornea, liver, heart, gallbladder and brain. Similarly, kidney is the most known transplantable organ also cited in the literature \\[[@ref2], [@ref7], [@ref9], [@ref12], [@ref13], [@ref14]\\]. This result may lead to the opinion that majority of the patients waiting for organ transplantation are those with renal failure, and this subject creates awareness as it is mentioned in the media more frequently. Furthermore, the first transplanted organ in our country was kidney, and this may have affected the results obtained.\n\nThe most important information source of the participants was determined as television/radio, followed by newspaper/journal, environment and friends, books and internet. The result of our research is in parallel with the information in the literature. In both domestic and foreign studies, the most important information sources about organ transplantation were determined as television/radio, newspaper and journals \\[[@ref6], [@ref15], [@ref16], [@ref17]\\]. Today, media and especially television are the most important information sources about health. As television is used widely by the people, it can be shown as the most important information source accessed by the people. It has been stated that the media, especially television, should be used actively in order to inform and direct people about organ donation, and related campaigns \\[[@ref18], [@ref19]\\]. However; in the studies to be conducted by means of media, negative views about organ donation, and therefore, disinformation and misdirection of the public should be prevented. It has been stated that the organ donation authorities and organizations should be in closer relationships with the media, and non-scientific, misinformative broadcasts and news should be prevented in this way \\[[@ref10]\\].\n\nMajority of the participants (71.7%) stated that they approved transplantation of their organs to other people after their death. Half of the students with positive views stated that they approved organ transplantation in order to be useful for others and most of them (83.7%) stated that they could donate all of their organs. In a study performed with university students in China, two- third of the students stated that they approved organ donation, and half of the participants had also positive views in this regard in another study \\[[@ref15], [@ref16]\\]. In the studies performed with a medical faculty students in Italy and Iran, four- fifth of the students stated that they had positive views about organ donation \\[[@ref20], [@ref21]\\]. In the studies performed in our country, the rates of positive views about organ donation varied between 21.0% and 91.1% \\[[@ref6], [@ref8], [@ref13], [@ref22]\\]. Although rates of positive views about organ donation reported in studies performed with the students of the faculty of health sciences are generally higher than those of our study, results of our study have similarities with those cited both in domestic and foreign literature. The fact that the students in medical faculties have more knowledge about the subject matter may have raised their awareness about this issue and led to these favourable results.\n\nThe students who had negative views about organ transplantation didn't desire to impair their body integrity, and thought that donating an organ was a profane act. Commitment of a sin and feeling pain were also indicated \\[[@ref6], [@ref7], [@ref13], [@ref23]\\]. In some researches performed in our country, the most important negative reasons about organ donation, and transplantation were stated as personal choice, never thinking about organ transplantation, fear, religious beliefs and lack of trust in physicians \\[[@ref9], [@ref11], [@ref24], [@ref25], [@ref26]\\]. Results similar to our outcomes were also found in the researches performed in other countries. In Europe, the most important reasons asserted against organ donation included abstention from social reaction, being reluctant to impair body integrity, reactions against hospitals and reluctance in decision for organ transplantation \\[[@ref12], [@ref27], [@ref28]\\]. The most important reason for these unfavourable attitudes is lack of knowledge about organ transplantation. Especially, the matters such as never thinking about organ transplantation, personal choice and religious beliefs which stand in the forefront of the studies support this opinion. Raising awareness about this issue is a must in order to make people think about organ donation, and the most important way to do this is to inform the people through education. Furthermore, although they aren't as commonly held as before, religious beliefs entertained against organ donation show lack of knowledge about Islam. Indeed, Islamic religion doesn't prohibit organ donation. Conversely, it is regarded as beneficial for society. The decree (dated 03.03.1980 and \\#396/13) issued by Supreme Council of Religious Affairs of Turkish Republic Directorate of Religious Affairs stated that organ transplantation was religiously permissable \\[[@ref29]\\]. All these results show that an education planning is required about organ transplantation which will encompass the entire society\n\nIn our study, while nearly half of the students had positive views about transplantation of organs of one of their relatives to another person after their death, half of them approved transplantation of the organs of a deprived person to other people after his/her death. The students with positive views stated that being useful to other people was the most important reason for organ donation. In many researches performed in our country, although not at a higher rate, the students had positive views about transplantation of the organs of their relatives or deprived people after their death \\[[@ref9], [@ref11], [@ref17]\\]. These results can be evaluated as that the people aren't very willing to donate the organs of their relatives. The most important reason for this unwillingness is that the relatives are not aware of the importance of organ donation after death, Therefore relatives should take initiatives in this respect as the people cannot be a donor without the approval of their relatives. The most important reason for the people to have negative views about donation of organs of their relatives is that they haven't got the right to decide or they don't want to take initiative, as seen in the results of our study and the other studies \\[[@ref9]\\]. Again in our study, majority of the students (84.1%) thought that a person should give his/her own decision about organ donation before his/her death which supports our opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, organ transplantation is an important problem in our country as is the case all around the world. While the number of people waiting for organ transplantation is increasing day by day, the number of donated organs is insufficient. It is known that the society should be informed and encouraged to participate in organ donation campaigns in order to increase the number of organ donations. Therefore, arranging campaigns about organ donation and using popular artists, sportsmen and similar people in these campaigns will be significant for informing the society about importance of the subject matter and increasing effectiveness of the campaigns. Furthermore, comprehensive studies should also be performed in order to determine knowledge, opinions, attitudes and negative views of the society in this aspect. Within the framework of these studies, it should be determined, whether or not customs, traditions and beliefs in the society affect organ transplantation and if so to what extent. Involvement of the health personnel in this process shall contribute significantly to the acquisition of comprehensive information. Especially enlightment of the society on these health issues can increase the knowledge level and awareness of the people about organ donation.\n\n**Conflict of Interest:** No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.\n\n**Financial Disclosure:** The authors declared that this study has received no financial support.\n",

    "In accordance with the Dallas criteria the histological diagnosis of acute myocarditis is defined by the presence of inflammatory cells in the myocardium associated with myocyte necrosis and degeneration of adjacent myocytes. This morphology, however, is only seen within the first 7 to 10 days of the acute stage of the disease. Later, most cases of clinically suspected acute myocarditis are histopathologically consistent with the diagnosis of \"borderline myocarditis\". Although endomyocardial biopsies have markedly improved diagnostic possibilities, the diagnosis of myocarditis by light microscopy has its limitations. Mainly the differentiation of infiltrating mononuclear cells from interstitial fibroblasts or pericytes is visually difficult. New immunohistochemical methods were therefore introduced to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the diagnosis. Using monoclonal antibodies against cell surface markers from lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) the identification, characterization and quantification of lymphocytic infiltrates in the myocardium is improved very significantly. Furthermore, the use of monoclonal antibodies against MHC-class-I and class-II-antigens provides further information about the immunological status of the myocardium. In conclusion, the use of these new immunohistological methods offers the possibility of establishing immunological criteria in addition to histological parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

How can I see what the max output on this power source is?\nIs the voltage changing heavily? I don't see any fluctuation on the meter.\nIs there something odd with the power source coming from the high voltage side due to it only being a two wire thermostat? The design works with the existing board, but I don't know how it deals with the fact that it only connects inline on the hot wire, no connection at all to neutral or ground. I assume it's allowing some current through all the time to get power for the main processor.\nAs I try to figure this out, I'm looking for pointers to help move it forward, and I've either not found what I want online, or I don't know the proper stuff to search for. Suggestions on what to try are appreciated, I do want to understand what I'm working with better over time.\n\nA:\n\nThe ATmega169P runs on 330\u00b5A (that's micro amperes.)  So, 0.33mA.\nThe Trinket uses a ATtiny85 that runs on 300\u00b5A.  It also, however, has an LED that turns on when it is running.  The Trinket schematic shows the LED connected through a 470Ohm resistor.  Given a 2Volt forward voltage for the green LED, and powered from 3.3Volts, you get about 3mA for just the LED.  That's a whole order of magnitude more than the original processor (ATmega169P.)\nIt is entirely possible that the high voltage side supplies very little current to the low voltage side since the original processor didn't need much current.  Your Trinket pulls 10 times as much current, and so may be just too much for the power supply.\nYou might try removing the series resistor from the LED on the Trinket (open the circuit to the LED so it doesn't light up.)  That should greatly reduce the current, and may get things running.\n\nI've answered what I think is the meat of your question.  Let me know if I've guessed wrong, and please do consider simplifying the question.\n\n",
    "ance E. Winters, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Victoria B. Wilson,\nSupervising Deputy Attorney General, Mark E. Weber, Deputy Attorney General, for\nPlaintiff and Respondent.\n\f                                    INTRODUCTION\n       Defendants and appellants Eric Ceballos and Cesar Ortega were tried together\nbefore separate juries. Ceballos\u2019s jury found Ceballos guilty of first degree murder (Pen.\nCode, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)1), assault with a semiautomatic firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (b)), and\nshooting at an occupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 246). The jury found true the allegation that\nCeballos committed each of the offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in\nassociation with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or\nassist in criminal conduct by gang members (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b) (gang enhancement\nallegation)); and the allegations that in the commission of the murder and shooting at an\noccupied motor vehicle offenses, a principal personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53,\nsubds. (b) & (e)(1)), personally discharged a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c) & (e)(1)),\nand personally discharged a firearm proximately causing great bodily injury or death\n(\u00a712022.53, subds. (d) & (e)(1)). Ortega\u2019s jury found Ortega guilty of first degree\nmurder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)), attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187, subd. (a)), and shooting at an\noccupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 246). As to all offenses, Ortega\u2019s jury found true a gang\nenhancement allegation (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)), and the allegations that a principal\npersonally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b) & (e)(1)), personally discharged a\nfirearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c) & (e)(1)), and personally discharged a firearm\nproximately causing great bodily injury or death (\u00a712022.53, subds. (d) & (e)(1)). The\ntrial court sentenced Ceballos and Ortega to state prison terms of 97 years to life and 84\nyears to life respectively.\n       On appeal, defendants contend that the trial court erred in admitting photographs\nthat showed them in the company of Toonerville gang members and in imposing sentence\nenhancements under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1) on\ntheir shooting at an occupied vehicle convictions. Ceballos further contends that the trial\ncourt erred in imposing a four-year section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(A) sentence\nenhancement on his assault with a semiautomatic firearm conviction. Ortega further\n\n\n1      All statutory citations are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.\n\n                                              2\n\fcontends that there was insufficient evidence to support his murder conviction; and the\nprosecution\u2019s expert witness testimony in support of the gang enhancement allegation\nwas hearsay; and the admission of that testimony violated his constitutional right of\nconfrontation. Ceballos and Ortega join each other\u2019s arguments. Respondent states that\nCeballos should have been awarded two additional days of custody credit and Ortega\nshould have been awarded six additional days. We order defendants\u2019 abstracts of\njudgment modified by striking the section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c)\nand (e)(1) sentence enhancements on their shooting at an occupied vehicle convictions.\nWe further order Ceballos\u2019s abstract of judgment modified to reflect 1,325 days of\ncustody credit, and Ortega\u2019s abstract of judgment modified to reflect 1,301 days of\ncustody credit. The judgments otherwise are affirmed.\n\n\n                                   BACKGROUND2\nI.     Evidence Presented to Both Juries\n       A.     The Shootings\n       On February 14, 2008, Martha Hosie and her girlfriends, including Claudia\nLedezma, were at Hosie\u2019s house. At some point, Hosie drove Ledezma to Steve Garcia\u2019s\nhouse in the Atwater area. After midnight, Garcia drove Hosie and Ledezma to a local\nbar where they remained until about 2:00 a.m. When they left the bar, Garcia was\ndriving, Ledezma was sitting in the front passenger seat, and Hosie was sitting in the\nback seat behind Ledezma.\n       As they drove, Garcia turned onto Carillon Street in Atwater Village, coming to a\nstop in the 2700 block. Two men approached the car from the passenger side. One man\n\n2       As noted above, the charges against Ceballos and Ortega were tried to separate\njuries. Certain evidence was presented only to Ceballos\u2019s jury and other evidence was\npresented only to Ortega\u2019s jury. Respondent\u2019s brief failed to segregate such testimony.\nCeballos moved this court to strike or disregard evidence presented only to Ortega\u2019s jury\nin resolving Ceballos\u2019s appeal. Respondent submitted a letter brief acknowledging and\ncorrecting its error. We grant Ceballos\u2019s motion to the extent that we disregard evidence\npresented only to Ortega\u2019s jury in resolving Ceballos\u2019s appeal. Likewise, we do not\nconsider evidence presented only to Ceballos\u2019s jury in resolving Ortega\u2019s appeal.\n\n                                             3\n\fstood directly next to Ledezma\u2019s door. Hosie believed that the second man stood two\nsteps to the left and five or six steps behind the man next to Ledezma\u2019s door. Ledezma\nbelieved that the second man stood to the right of the man next to Ledezma\u2019s door, close\nto the car. Ledezma described the man in front as being no more than five feet, nine\ninches tall and stocky. He was wearing a white shirt, a \u201choodie,\u201d and a blue hat that he\nwore backwards.\n       The man in front tapped on Ledezma\u2019s window with a gun that appeared to be a\nsemiautomatic firearm. Hosie heard the man ask, \u201cWhere are you from, homey?\u201d At\ntrial, Ledezma identified Ceballos as the man who tapped on her window with the gun.\nShe testified that she got a good look at the man standing next to Ceballos and he was not\nin the courtroom. The inquiry, \u201cWhere are you from\u201d is a common phrase gang members\nuse to challenge a gang member from another territory or to determine a person\u2019s gang\nmembership. After the inquiry, Hosie heard multiple gunshots. Ledezma did not hear\nCeballos say anything, but heard a series of gunshots after Ceballos tapped on the\nwindow. According to Ledezma, Ceballos reached into the car and fired his gun.\n       Hosie yelled to Garcia to \u201cdrive.\u201d Garcia tried to drive away but crashed into a\nlight pole. Ledezma heard additional gunshots after the car crashed, and saw Ceballos\nand the second man run to a car and drive away. Ceballos\u2019s hat fell off as he ran to the\ncar.\n       Ledezma got out of the car and called 911. The 911 operator asked Ledezma her\nlocation. Because she did not know, Ledezma walked to the next street to read the street\nsign. Ledezma gave the 911 operator her location and returned to Garcia\u2019s car where she\ndetermined that she had been shot in the left elbow. Ledezma\u2019s gunshot wound required\ntwo surgeries and left her with a 12-inch scar. Garcia sustained fatal gunshot wounds.\n       About 3:00 a.m. on February 15, 2008, an Hispanic man entered the Pacifica\nHospital emergency room with a gunshot wound to his neck. The man told a security\nguard that he had a friend in a car who needed help. The security guard went outside\nwith a wheelchair and assisted the man into the hospital. The security guard could not\nremember the nature of that man\u2019s injuries. Around 3:00 a.m. on February 15, 2008, Los\n\n                                            4\n\fAngeles Police Officer Randy Blandford responded to a call at the Pacifica Hospital\nabout two shooting victims. Officer Blandford identified Ceballos and Ortega as the\nshooting victims.\n       Los Angeles Police Department officers responded to the scene of Garcia\u2019s\nshooting. In their investigation, they determined that both sides of Garcia\u2019s car had\nmultiple bullet strikes from different angles. There were several bullet strikes on the\ndriver\u2019s door, and both driver\u2019s side windows were smashed. The windshield had\nmultiple bullet holes, most of which were on the passenger side. The front passenger\nwindow was \u201cpartially\u201d rolled down. In the street, officers found seven spent casings that\nappeared to have been from a nine-millimeter handgun, bullet fragments, a baseball hat,\nand a live \u201cround\u201d or bullet. They recovered two casings inside Garcia\u2019s car and one\nspent casing on the car near the windshield.\n       Los Angeles Police Department Firearms Analysis Unit Criminalist William\nMoore testified that of the spent casings recovered, eight were fired from the same nine-\nmillimeter semiautomatic handgun. The live bullet that was recovered was cycled\nthrough a second nine-millimeter semiautomatic firearm. A spent casing also was fired\nfrom that second firearm. According to Moore, two bullets recovered from Garcia by the\ncoroner, a bullet recovered from the driver\u2019s door, and a bullet found next to Garcia\u2019s\nbody were fired from a .38-caliber revolver. A bullet recovered from Ledezma\u2019s elbow\nwas \u201cmost consistent\u201d with a .38- or .357-caliber bullet, and not with a nine-millimeter\nbullet. However, Ledezma\u2019s bodily fluids had eroded some of the bullet\u2019s\n\u201cindividualizing features\u201d preventing further identification.\n       Moore was able to identify clearly three guns that were fired at the murder scene.\nWith respect to two of the guns, and presumably as to the third gun, Moore testified that\nthere was no way for him to determine whether they were at the crime scene that night.\nThere was other bullet evidence that was fired from a fourth firearm, i.e., not from either\nof the identified nine-millimeter semiautomatic or the .38-caliber revolver handguns.\nMoore could not specifically identify additional other bullet evidence as having been\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\ffired from a particular gun. Assuming such evidence was produced by independent\nfirearms, it was possible there were additional firearms at the murder scene.\n       Tests on the brim or sweatband of the hat recovered from the murder scene\nrevealed DNA from at least two persons. Ortega could have been the source of the\nDNA\u2014one out of 10,000 persons has a DNA profile that could fit within the DNA\nmixture on the hat. Ceballos was excluded as a DNA source. Tests on a blood swab\ntaken at the murder scene matched Ortega\u2019s DNA\u2014one out of 100 trillion persons would\nmatch the blood sample.\n       Los Angeles County Coroner\u2019s Office Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Ajay\nPanchal performed the autopsy on Garcia\u2019s body. Dr. Panchal testified that Garcia\nsuffered 15 gunshot wounds, four of which were fatal by themselves. Four of the\ngunshot wounds entered the left side of Garcia\u2019s body with a left-to-right path. Dr.\nPanchal recovered six bullets or bullet fragments in the autopsy.\n       In April 2008, Los Angeles Police Department Detective Harold DiCroce showed\nLedezma a six-pack photographic lineup. Ceballos\u2019s photograph was photograph No. 3.\nLedezma circled photograph Nos. 1 and 3, believing they could have been the man she\nsaw holding the gun the night of Garcia\u2019s murder. Detective DiCroce then left Ledezma\nalone in the interview room. While Detective DiCroce was away, Ledezma took another\nlook at the photographs and identified No. 3 as the person she saw. When Detective\nDiCroce returned to the interview room, Ledezma did not tell him that she had identified\nphotograph No. 3 and was excluding No. 1. It did not occur to her to do so. At trial,\nLedezma testified that she was positive that Ceballos was one of the shooters. She\ntestified, \u201cFacial features, or when you go to bed every night looking at that face over and\nover, you just know.\u201d\n       Detective DiCroce also showed Ledezma a six-pack photographic lineup\ncontaining Ortega\u2019s photograph. Ledezma did not identify Ortega from the lineup.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       B.     The Gang Evidence\n       Los Angeles Police Department Sergeant John Strasner, the prosecution\u2019s gang\nexpert, testified that the primary activities of the Toonerville gang were drugs sales,\nassaults with deadly weapons, and murder. On April 8, 2009, Toonerville gang member\nPatrick Evans was convicted of a murder committed on December 24, 2006.3 On March\n7, 2008, Toonerville gang member Assael Aguirre was convicted of a murder, an\nattempted murder, and a shooting at an occupied vehicle committed on April 24, 2006.\n       Sergeant Strasner testified that the Rascals and Toonerville gangs were rivals with\na history of violent crimes against each other that included assaults, shootings, and\nmurders. Garcia was a member of the Rascals gang. Ceballos and Ortega were members\nof the Toonerville gang. The territories of the Rascals and Toonerville gangs bordered\none another. The location of Garcia\u2019s and Ledezma\u2019s shooting was \u201cvery, very deep\u201d in\nRascals territory. Sergeant Strasner opined that a hypothetical shooting by a gang\nmember based on facts similar to this case would have been committed for the\nfurtherance of the gang.\n       According to Sergeant Strasner, Danny Huerta was a Toonerville gang member.\nOn February 16, 2008, the day after Garcia\u2019s murder, Sergeant Strasner, responding to a\ncall concerning an armed person selling narcotics, saw Huerta throw a handgun inside the\ntrunk of a red Geo Storm. The car was registered to Maricela Serna Garcia, mother of\nToonerville gang member Gabriel Serna.4 The police searched the car and found, among\nother handguns, a .38-caliber revolver in the glove box. Two of the bullets recovered\nfrom Garcia during his autopsy, the bullet found in the driver\u2019s door, and the bullet found\nnext to Garcia\u2019s body were fired from that .38-caliber revolver. According to Sergeant\n\n\n\n\n3      Sergeant Strasner also inconsistently testified that Evans was charged with murder\non or about December 24, 2006.\n\n4     The jury was shown a photograph of Ceballos, Ortega, Serna, and another\nphotograph of Ceballos, Ortega, Serna, and Huerta.\n\n                                              7\n\fStrasner, commonly, a gang member who has used a gun to commit some kind of act will\npass the gun to another gang member.\n\n\nII.    Evidence Presented Only to Ortega\u2019s Jury\n       On February 14, 2008, Lindsay Lilburn and her fianc\u00e9 Richard Clayborn were at\nOrtega\u2019s apartment. Clayborn was a Toonerville gang member. Ortega, Ceballos,\n\u201cJoker,\u201d \u201cScooby,\u201d and Ortega\u2019s wife also were present at the apartment. At some point,\nClayborn, Ortega, Ceballos, Joker, and Scooby had a conversation about going to\n\u201cTrash\u201d\u2014a term used to refer to the Rascals gang\u2019s neighborhood. \u201cThey\u201d attempted to\nconvince Clayborn to go to \u201cTrash\u201d\u2014Ortega asked Clayborn if he wanted to go to Trash.\nClayborn declined. Ceballos was part of the conversation, but Lilburn did not remember\nanything specific that he said. She knew, however, that \u201che went.\u201d Lilburn wanted to go\nhome, and Clayborn went with her. Lilburn and Clayborn lived \u201cquite a distance\u201d from\nOrtega\u2019s apartment. They left Ortega\u2019s apartment late in the evening. About two hours\nafter they arrived home, Ortega called Lilburn and told her that he had been shot and\nthought he was paralyzed.\n       In October 2008, Clayborn was arrested. He was charged with murder in 2009. In\nan attempt to help Clayborn, Lilburn gave the police information about the \u201cValentine\u2019s\nDay\u201d murder. Lilburn believed the police would release Clayborn if she cooperated.\nLilburn was given immunity in the case against Clayborn. Lilburn testified that she did\nnot lie to the police and was not lying on the stand. Lilburn admitted that she was a\nmethamphetamine addict with a long history of drug arrests. She had been put into a\ndrug treatment program following a recent arrest. Lilburn\u2019s drug use impaired her\nmemory. She was drinking, but not using drugs on February 14, 2008.\n       Around 3:00 a.m. on February 15, 2008, Los Angeles Police Department Officer\nKeith Hopkins responded to a call at Pacifica Hospital about two shooting victims.\nThere, he spoke with Ortega, one of the victims. Ortega had been shot in the abdomen.\nOrtega told Officer Hopkins that about an hour earlier, he was sitting on a bus stop bench\nnear the intersection of San Fernando Road and Maclay Street when he was shot and fell\n\n                                             8\n\fto the ground. Ortega did not see anything and did not remember anything else about the\nshooting. He told the officer that an unknown person in an unknown type of black\nvehicle took him to the hospital. Ortega was uncooperative in the investigation and\nappeared not to want to speak with Officer Hopkins. Officer Joseph Villagran went to\nthe intersection of San Fernando Road and Maclay Street and was unable to find any\nevidence of a shooting such as casings, stray bullets, or blood.\n       On February 15, Detective DiCroce learned that two Toonerville gang members\nhad been admitted to Pacifica Hospital about a half an hour after the shooting in Atwater\nVillage. On February 17, Detective DiCroce interviewed Ortega at Northridge Hospital,\nto which Ortega had been transferred. At first, Ortega stood by the story he previously\nhad told the police, i.e., that he had been by himself when he was shot at Maclay and San\nFernando Road and he was taken to the hospital by an unknown person. Detective\nDiCroce pressed Ortega, telling him that his story did not make sense\u2014that he was shot\nat one location, a car picked him up, and a second gang member who also had been shot\nat a different location was in the car. Ortega continued to claim that he had been shot at\nMaclay and San Fernando Road, but added that Ceballos had been with him. Ortega\nexplained that he did not want to get in trouble with his girlfriend\u2014he and Ceballos had\nbeen out \u201cmeeting some girls\u201d near Maclay and San Fernando Road when they were shot.\nOrtega denied being at the homicide scene in Atwater, and did not know who shot him or\nwhy.\n\n\nIII.   Evidence Presented Only to Ceballos\u2019s Jury\n       When Officer Blandford interviewed Ceballos at the hospital, he believed that\nCeballos was a gunshot victim. Ceballos told the officer that about a half an hour earlier\nhe was walking on Osborne Street near Glenoaks when a car pulled to the curb next to\nhim. A person in the car asked, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Ceballos responded,\n\u201cToonerville.\u201d The car\u2019s passenger produced a handgun and shot Ceballos three times.\nThe car fled, and a friend Ceballos did not identify gave him a ride to Pacifica Hospital.\nCeballos did not appear to Officer Blandford to be cooperative. Officer Villagran went to\n\n                                             9\n\fthe area of Osborne Street where Ceballos claimed to have been shot and did not find\nevidence that there had been a shooting.\n       On February 17, 2008, Detective DiCroce interviewed Ceballos at the hospital.\nCeballos stuck with part of his story, but added that he was with Ortega \u201cmeeting some\ngirls\u201d when he was shot.\n       Detective DiCroce arrested Ceballos on July 21, 2008. Detectives DiCroce and\nLisa Governo interviewed Ceballos. A recording of the interview was played for the\njury. In the interview Ceballos said that he was with Ortega5 and \u201csome girls\u201d near\nMaclay and Foothill in Sylmar when he was shot. He said he lied at the hospital because\nhis girlfriend was present. A man unknown to Ceballos drove him and Ortega to the\nhospital.\n       Detective DiCroce showed Ceballos a picture of the hat that had Ortega\u2019s DNA on\nit and said the hat was found at a homicide scene. He told Ceballos that he spoke with\nOrtega, that Ortega admitted that he was at the homicide scene, and that Ortega said that\nCeballos was with him at the homicide scene. Ceballos said that Ortega told him to say\nthey were together. Detective DiCroce said he did not believe Ceballos and advised him\nto tell the truth. Ceballos responded that he was on Osborn Street in Pacoima when he\nwas shot. Ceballos did not know that he and Ortega were at the same hospital until\nOrtega called him a few days later.\n       Detective DiCroce expressed doubt that Ceballos and Ortega were shot in different\nparts of the city, that they were picked up by the same car and taken to the hospital, and\nthat Ortega called Ceballos a few days later and asked him to say they were together\nwhen they were shot. Ceballos then admitted that he was \u201cthere\u201d with Ortega, but denied\nthat he had a gun. He said he drove Ortega and \u201cSnoopy\u201d to a location in the Rascals\u2019\nneighborhood and parked. Ortega and Snoopy got out got out of the car. Ceballos heard\n\n5      Ceballos and the detectives refer to \u201cCesar\u201d throughout the interview. Cesar is\nOrtega\u2019s first name. Ceballos does not contend that the references to \u201cCesar\u201d were to\nsomeone other than Ortega. For consistency, we will use Ortega\u2019s last name. The parties\nstipulated that Ceballos\u2019s jury was not to consider the detectives\u2019 references to\ninformation obtained from Ortega as true but as \u201cinterrogation techniques.\u201d\n\n                                            10\n\fshots. Ceballos determined that Ortega was shot and went to get him. While doing so,\nCeballos was shot. Snoopy drove Ceballos and Ortega to Chevy Chase Park. Someone\nelse got into the car and drove Ceballos and Ortega to the hospital. Ceballos did not\nknow that Ortega and Snoopy were armed with guns or what their intentions were.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\nI.     Sufficiency of Evidence in Support of Ortega\u2019s Murder Conviction\n       Ortega contends that there is insufficient evidence to support his murder\nconviction.6 Sufficient evidence supports the conviction.\n\n\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       \u201c\u2018When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\nconviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to\ndetermine whether it contains substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable,\ncredible, and of solid value\u2014from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Avila (2009) 46\nCal.4th 680, 701.) \u201cWe must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every\nfact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [Citation.]\u201d\n(People v. Medina (2009) 46 Cal.4th 913, 919.) \u201cA reversal for insufficient evidence \u2018is\nunwarranted unless it appears \u201cthat upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient\nsubstantial evidence to support\u201d\u2019 the jury\u2019s verdict. [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Zamudio\n(2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 357.) \u201cIn deciding the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing\ncourt resolves neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts. [Citation.] Resolution\nof conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive province of the trier of\nfact.\u201d (People v. Young (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1181.)\n\n6       Ortega appears to confine his argument to his murder conviction. To the extent\nthat his claim that there was no evidence that established that he was present at the\nmurder scene or was a shooter was intended to apply to all of his convictions and\nsentence enhancements, our holding that there is sufficient evidence to support Ortega\u2019s\nmurder conviction applies also to those other convictions and the sentence enhancements.\n\n                                             11\n\f       \u201cSubstantial evidence includes circumstantial evidence and the reasonable\ninferences flowing therefrom.\u201d (People v. Ugalino (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1060, 1064.)\n\u201cWe \u2018must accept logical inferences that the jury might have drawn from the\ncircumstantial evidence. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation].\u201d (People v. Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal.4th\nat pp. 357\u2013358.) \u201cThe standard of review is the same when the prosecution relies mainly\non circumstantial evidence.\u201d (People v. Valdez (2004) 32 Cal.4th 73, 104.)\n\n\n       B.     Application of Relevant Principles\n       Ortega contends that his murder conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence\nbecause the prosecution did not present an eyewitness who saw him with a gun, or saw\nhim shoot Garcia or Ledezma, or even placed him at the scene of the murder. The only\nevidence that he was present, defendant contends, was his DNA on the hat that was found\nin the street. He apparently argues that we should disregard Lilburn\u2019s testimony because\nit was \u201cseriously compromised\u201d as she assisted the police by providing information about\nthe \u201cValentine\u2019s Day\u201d murder in an effort to help Clayborn in his murder prosecution and\nby her drug use that impaired her memory.\n       Sufficient evidence supports Ortega\u2019s conviction. Ortega was a member of the\nToonerville gang. The Toonerville and Rascals gangs were rivals with a history of\nviolent crimes against each other including assaults, shootings, and murders. According\nto Lilburn, hours before the murder, Ortega and other Toonerville gang members,\nincluding Ceballos, gathered at Ortega\u2019s apartment. At some point, Ortega and Ceballos,\nwhom an eyewitness identified as one of the shooters, and the others discussed going to\nthe Rascals gang\u2019s territory. Ortega asked Clayborn if he wanted to go to the Rascals\ngang\u2019s territory.\n       After Garcia left the bar at 2:00 a.m., he was shot at a location deep in the Rascals\ngang\u2019s territory. Ortega\u2019s blood was found at the scene of Garcia\u2019s murder. Ortega\narrived at the Pacifica Hospital with a gunshot wound around 3:00 a.m. Ortega later\nadmitted that he was with Ceballos when he was shot, although he claimed to have been\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fshot at Maclean Street and San Fernando Road. The police did not find any evidence that\nthere had been a shooting at that location.\n       Ledezma testified that two men approached the passenger side of Garcia\u2019s car\u2014\nCeballos, who fired shots into the car, and a second man whom she got a good look at\nand whom she did not identify as Ortega. Ledezma and Hosie believed that Ceballos was\narmed with a semiautomatic handgun. Ceballos fired his handgun from the passenger\nside of the car. The ballistics evidence showed that Garcia was shot with a .38-caliber\nrevolver from the driver\u2019s side of the car. Ledezma was shot in the left elbow with a\nbullet that was \u201cmost consistent\u201d with a .38- or .357-caliber bullet and not a nine-\nmillimeter bullet. A jury reasonably could conclude from such evidence that Ceballos\nand Ortega shot at Garcia from opposite sides of Garcia\u2019s car\u2014Ceballos with a nine-\nmillimeter semiautomatic handgun from the passenger side and Ortega with a .38-caliber\nrevolver from the driver\u2019s side; that Ortega shot Garcia and Ledezma with a .38-caliber\nrevolver; and that Ceballos and Ortega inadvertently shot each other in the process.\n       As for Ortega\u2019s challenge to Ledezma\u2019s credibility, her credibility was a matter for\nthe jury to decide. (People v. Jones (1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314 [\u201cAlthough we must\nensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, nonetheless it is the\nexclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and\nthe truth or falsity of the facts on which that determination depends. [Citation.] Thus, if\nthe verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we must accord due deference to the trier\nof fact and not substitute our evaluation of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the fact\nfinder. [Citations.]\u201d].)\n\n\nII.    Admission of Photographs\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred in admitting photographs of them\nwith Serna, a fellow Toonerville gang member, and the error violated their constitutional\nrights to freedom of association and to a fair trial. The photographs lacked relevance,\ndefendants argue, \u201cbecause the evidence failed to establish any nexus between Serna and\nthe car, Serna and the guns found in the car or [defendants] and the guns, the car or\n\n                                              13\n\fSerna\u2019s mother.\u201d Absent any such nexus, defendants reason, photographs that proved\nthey were acquainted with Serna did not support any reasonable inference that either of\nthem conveyed to Serna a gun used in the shooting or connected either of them to the gun\nat the time of the shooting.\n       \u201c\u2018\u201cThe rules pertaining to the admissibility of photographic evidence are well-\nsettled. Only relevant evidence is admissible [citations], and all relevant evidence is\nadmissible unless excluded under the federal or California Constitution or by statute.\n[Citations.] Relevant evidence is defined in Evidence Code section 210 as evidence\n\u2018having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of\nconsequence to the determination of the action.\u2019 The test of relevance is whether the\nevidence tends \u2018\u201clogically, naturally, and by reasonable inference\u201d to establish material\nfacts such as identity, intent, or motive. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] The trial court has\nbroad discretion in determining the relevance of evidence [citations] but lacks discretion\nto admit irrelevant evidence. [Citations.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Carter\n(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1114, 1166\u20131167.) \u201cA trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting\nor excluding evidence is reviewable for abuse [citation] and will not be disturbed except\non a showing the trial court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently\nabsurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice [citation].\u201d (People v.\nRodriguez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 9-10.)\n       Even assuming that the trial court erred in admitting photographic evidence that\ndemonstrated that Ceballos and Ortega knew Serna, any such error was harmless under\neither Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt standard] or People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [reasonable probability of\na more favorable result standard]. As to Ortega, the evidence showed that he was a\nmember of the Toonerville gang, which gang had a violent rivalry with the Rascals gang.\nHours before Garcia and Ledezma were shot, Ortega and Ceballos discussed going to\nRascals gang territory. Garcia and Ledezma were shot at a location deep in the Rascals\ngang\u2019s territory. Ledezma identified Ceballos as one of the shooters and Ortega\u2019s blood\nwas found at the scene. Around the time of Garcia\u2019s murder, Ortega and Ceballos went\n\n                                              14\n\fto the Pacifica Hospital with gunshot wounds. Ortega told the police that he was shot at\nMaclean Street and San Fernando Road, but the police did not find any evidence that\nthere had been a shooting at that location. Based on such evidence, it is beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Ortega\u2019s jury would have reached the same verdicts if the\nphotographs of Ortega with Serna had been excluded.\n       It also is beyond a reasonable doubt that Ceballos\u2019s jury would have reached the\nsame verdicts if the challenged photographic evidence had been excluded. As Ortega, the\nevidence showed that Ceballos was a member of the Toonerville gang; that the\nToonerville gang had a violent rivalry with the Rascals gang; and that Garcia and\nLedezma were shot at a location deep in the Rascals gang\u2019s territory. Ceballos admitted\nthat he drove Ortega and \u201cSnoopy\u201d to a location in the Rascal\u2019s neighborhood and\nparked, and that he heard gunfire at that location. The evidence also firmly established\nCeballos as one of the shooters. Ledezma, an eyewitness to the shooting, observed at\nclose range the shooter who tapped on her window before reaching into Garcia\u2019s car and\nshooting Garcia. She identified Ceballos as that shooter. Ledezma\u2019s testimony alone\nwas sufficient to support Ceballos\u2019s convictions. (People v. Young, supra, 34 Cal.4th at\np. 1181 [the testimony of a single witness is sufficient to support a conviction unless it is\nphysically impossible or inherently improbable]. ) Moreover, although he denied being\na shooter, Ceballos admitted that he was with Ortega at the scene of the murder.\n\n\nIII.   Sergeant Strasner\u2019s Testimony\n       Ortega contends that Sergeant Strasner\u2019s expert witness testimony about the\npredicate offenses for the section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C) gang enhancement7\u2014\n\n\n7       \u201cA criminal street gang is any ongoing association that has as one of its primary\nactivities the commission of certain criminal offenses and engages through its members\nin a \u2018pattern of criminal gang activity.\u2019 (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (f); see People v. Loeun (1997)\n17 Cal.4th 1, 4 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 947 P.2d 1313].) A pattern of criminal gang activity\nis \u2018the commission of, attempted commission of, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of,\nsustained juvenile petition for, or conviction of two or more\u2019 specified criminal offenses\nwithin a certain time frame, \u2018on separate occasions, or by two or more persons\u2019 (the\n\n                                             15\n\fEvans\u2019s and Aguirre\u2019s prior convictions\u2014was hearsay and its admission violated his\nconstitutional right of confrontation. (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Crawford v. Washington\n(2004) 541 U.S. 36.) Ortega also appears to contend that there was insufficient evidence\nto support the gang enhancement because there was no evidence that he previously\ncommitted a crime for the benefit of the Toonerville gang or that he was an active\nmember at the time of the offenses in this case. Ortega\u2019s claims fail.\n       The failure to object to the admission of evidence on hearsay or right of\nconfrontation grounds in the trial court forfeits appellate review. (People v. Bolin (1998)\n18 Cal.4th 297, 320 [hearsay claim]; People v. Riccardi (2012) 54 Cal.4th 758, 827, fn.\n33 [Sixth Amendment confrontation clause claim].) Because Ortega did not object to the\nadmission of Sergeant Strasner\u2019s testimony on hearsay or confrontation clause grounds,\nhe has forfeited appellate review.\n       Defendant cites no authority for his apparent contention that there was insufficient\nevidence to support the gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C)\nbecause the enhancement may not be imposed absent proof that he previously committed\nan offense for the benefit of the gang. To the extent that defendant more specifically\ncontends that a defendant charged under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C) must have\ncommitted a predicate offense within the meaning of the statute, he likewise cites no\nsupporting authority. By its terms, section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C)8 does not\n\n\n\u2018predicate offenses\u2019). (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (e); see Loeun, at p. 4.)\u201d (People v. Tran (2011)\n51 Cal.4th 1040, 1044.)\n\n8       Section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(C) provides:\n        \u201c(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5), any person who is convicted\nof a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any\ncriminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal\nconduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, in addition and\nconsecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which he\nor she has been convicted, be punished as follows:\n        \u201c[\u00b6-\u00b6]\n        \u201c(C) If the felony is a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section\n667.5, the person shall be punished by an additional term of 10 years.\u201d\n\n                                             16\n\frequire the prosecution to prove that a defendant committed a prior offense that\nbenefitted the gang or that qualified as a predicate offense. Instead, prosecutors may\nprove predicate offense through crimes committed by gang members other than the\ndefendant. (See People v. Hill (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1104, 1137-1138 & fn. 25\n[evidence of crimes by eight gang members other than the defendant]; People v. Tran,\nsupra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 1044, 1046, 1050 [although a defendant\u2019s offense on a separate\noccasion may serve as a predicate offense for gang enhancement purposes, the trial court\nhas the discretion to exclude evidence of such an offense under Evidence Code section\n352].)\n         As for defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecution failed to adduce evidence\ndemonstrating that he was a Toonerville gang member at the time the offenses were\ncommitted, \u201csection 186.22 does not require that the defendant be an active or current\nmember of the criminal street gang that benefits from his crime. [Citation.]\u201d (People v.\nBragg (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1402; see People v. Valdez (2012) 55 Cal.4th 82,\n132 [a defendant\u2019s gang membership is \u201cneither necessary nor sufficient to establish any\nelement of the gang enhancement\u201d].) Accordingly, defendant\u2019s claim of insufficient\nevidence is unavailing.\n\n\nIV.      Ceballos\u2019s Section 186.22, Subdivision (b)(1)(A) Gang Enhancement on His\n         Assault With a Semiautomatic Firearm Conviction\n         The jury found Ceballos guilty of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and found\ntrue the accompanying gang enhancement allegation under section 186.22, subdivision\n(b). The trial court imposed a four-year term for the gang enhancement. (\u00a7186.22, subd.\n(b)(1)(A).) Ceballos contends that under section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(2)9, the\n\n9       Section 12022.53, subdivision (e) provides:\n        \u201c(e)(1) The enhancements provided in this section shall apply to any person who is\na principal in the commission of an offense if both of the following are pled and proved:\n        \u201c(A) The person violated subdivision (b) of Section 186.22.\n        \u201c(B) Any principal in the offense committed any act specified in subdivision (b),\n(c), or (d).\n\n                                             17\n\fimposition of the 25 years to life section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1)\nenhancements on his convictions for murder and shooting at an occupied motor vehicle\n(stayed pursuant to section 654) precluded imposition of the four-year gang enhancement\non his assault with a semiautomatic firearm conviction. We disagree.\n       We review the construction of a statute de novo. (Regents of University of\nCalifornia v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 509, 531.) \u201c\u2018In construing a statute, our\nrole is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\n[Citation.] In determining intent, we must look first to the words of the statute because\nthey are the most reliable indicator of legislative intent. [Citation.] If the statutory\nlanguage is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute governs. [Citation.]\u2019\n(People v. Lopez (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1051, 1056 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 432, 79 P.3d 548].) In\nother words, if there is \u2018no ambiguity or uncertainty in the language, the Legislature is\npresumed to have meant what it said,\u2019 and it is not necessary to \u2018resort to legislative\nhistory to determine the statute\u2019s true meaning.\u2019 (People v. Cochran (2002) 28 Cal.4th\n396, 400\u2013401 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 48 P.3d 1148].)\u201d (People v. Licas (2007) 41 Cal.4th\n362, 367.) \u201cWe begin by examining the statute\u2019s words, giving them a plain and\ncommonsense meaning.\u201d (People v. Murphy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142.) \u201c[W]hen a\nstatute defining a crime or punishment is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations,\nthe appellate court should ordinarily adopt that interpretation more favorable to the\ndefendant. [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Avery (2002) 27 Cal.4th 49, 57.)\n       Ceballos contends that the phrase \u201cin the commission of the offense\u201d in\nsubdivision (e)(2) of section 12022.53 is not clear and unambiguous and thus requires\njudicial interpretation. He argues that the phrase should be interpreted broadly to\npreclude imposition of a section 186.22 gang enhancement when a section 12022.53\nenhancement based on a principal\u2019s firearm use or discharge has been imposed on\n\n       \u201c(2) An enhancement for participation in a criminal street gang pursuant to\nChapter 11 (commencing with Section 186.20) of Title 7 of Part 1 shall not be imposed\non a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this subdivision, unless\nthe person personally used or personally discharged a firearm in the commission of the\noffense.\u201d\n\n                                              18\n\fanother conviction that was part of a continuous transaction. Accordingly, Ceballos\nargues, because the sentence enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivision (d) and\n(e)(1) on his murder and shooting at an occupied motor vehicle convictions were based\non a principal\u2019s use of a firearm as part of a continuing transaction and not on a finding\nthat he personally used or discharged a firearm, the section 186.22 gang enhancement on\nhis assault with a semiautomatic firearm conviction must be stricken.\n       The trial court properly enhanced Ceballos\u2019s sentence under section 186.22 on his\nassault with a semiautomatic firearm conviction. Subdivision (e)(2) of section 12022.53\nprecludes imposition of a section 186.22 gang enhancement in addition to a section\n12022.53 enhancement unless the defendant was found to have \u201cpersonally used or\npersonally discharged a firearm in the commission of the offense.\u201d10 The phrase \u201cin the\ncommission of the offense\u201d is clear and unambiguous and plainly bars multiple sentence\nenhancements\u2014i.e, sentence enhancements under sections 12022.53 and 186.22\u2014on the\nsame offense. Accordingly, because the sentence for Ceballos\u2019s assault with a\nsemiautomatic firearm conviction was not and could not be enhanced under section\n12022.53 because it was not an enumerated offense under subdivision (a), the multiple\nsentence enhancement bar in subdivision (e)(2) necessarily did not preclude the trial court\nfrom enhancing Ceballos\u2019s sentence under section 186.22.\n\n\nV.     Defendants\u2019 Section 12022.53, Subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1)\n       Enhancements for Their Shooting at an Occupied Motor Vehicle Convictions\n       As to defendants\u2019 convictions for shooting at an occupied motor vehicle, the jury\nfound true the allegations that a principal personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds.\n(b) & (e)(1)), personally discharged a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c) & (e)(1)), and\npersonally discharged a firearm proximately causing great bodily injury or death\n(\u00a712022.53, subds. (d) & (e)(1)). The trial court trial court imposed each of the sentence\n\n10     The offenses to which the section 12022.53 enhancements apply are enumerated in\nsubdivision (a) of that section. Assault with a semiautomatic firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (b)) is\nnot an enumerated offense.\n\n                                             19\n\fenhancements. Pursuant to People v. Gonzalez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1118, 1129-1130, the\ntrial court stayed the sentence on the section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c)\nand (e)(1) enhancements, and, pursuant to section 654, stayed the sentences on\ndefendants\u2019 convictions for shooting at an occupied motor vehicle, including the\nenhancements under subdivision (d) and (e)(1).\n       Defendants contend that the sentence enhancements under section 12022.53,\nsubdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1) must be stricken and not stayed because\nthey were not charged in the information and because shooting at an occupied motor\nvehicle (\u00a7 246) is not one of the enumerated offenses under section 12022.53, subdivision\n(a), to which the subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1) enhancements apply.\nRespondent agrees, as do we, that the challenged enhancements must be stricken as\nsection 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1) do not apply to violations\nof section 246.11 (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (a).)\n\n\nVI.    Custody Credits\n       Laudably, respondent has identified sentencing errors that benefit defendants.\nRespondent states that the trial court erred in awarding Ceballos 1,323 days rather than\n1,325 days of custody credit, and in awarding Ortega 1,295 days rather than 1,301 days\nof custody credit. We agree and order defendants\u2019 abstracts of judgment modified\naccordingly.\n       A defendant is entitled to credit for all days in custody commencing with the day\nof arrest (People v. Taylor (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 628, 645) and including partial days\nand the day of sentencing (People v. Browning (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1410, 1412;\nPeople v. Fugate (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1408, 1414). Ceballos was arrested on July 21,\n2008, and sentenced on March 6, 2012, a period of 1,325 days. The trial court\n\n11     Because we hold that the challenged enhancements must be stricken as\nsubdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1) do not apply to violations of section 246, we\nneed not reach the issue of whether the enhancements must be stricken because they were\nnot specifically alleged in the information with respect to the shooting at an occupied\nmotor vehicle count.\n\n                                             20\n\ferroneously awarded Ceballos 1,323 days of custody credit. Ortega was arrested on\nAugust 14, 2008, and sentenced on March 6, 2012, a period of 1,301 days. The trial\ncourt erroneously awarded Ortega 1,295 days of custody credit. We order Ceballos\u2019s\nabstract of judgment modified to reflect 1,325 days of custody credit, and Ortega\u2019s\nabstract of judgment modified to reflect 1,301 days of custody credit.\n\n\n                                     DISPOSITION\n      Ceballos\u2019s abstract of judgment is ordered modified by striking the section\n12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1) sentence enhancements on his\nshooting at an occupied vehicle conviction (\u00a7 246), and by reflecting an award of 1,325\ndays of custody credit. Ortega\u2019s abstract of judgment is ordered modified by striking the\nsection 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (e)(1) and (c) and (e)(1) sentence enhancements\non his shooting at an occupied vehicle conviction (\u00a7 246), and by reflecting an award of\n1,301 days of custody credit.

    "said NO!?!\n\nI was puzzled and said \u201cwell, that once again proves that length doesn\u2019t matter\u201d, and she agreed.\n\nI mean, WTF?!?\n\nI inserted a dildo bigger that most dicks into her and she does not even NOTICE?!? I am not sure if this is good news or bad news. On the one hand, it means that length does not add to the pleasure for her, while girth does. (This is good because I have a short dick.) On the other hand, I mean, what does it take for her to notice that she is getting fucked by a huge one? a telephone pole?\n\nOn a side note, she made some deep and grunting moans while I fucked her with that big thing which I rarely, if ever, have heard from her. I think this is the \u201coh man you are so fucking huge\u201d moan that many guys here, including myself, are out for.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n09-22-2003, 07:44 PM\n\nKojack10\n\nFirst off, I would like to thank you for posting information about your size experiment with her. I think that more guys should experiment with various sized objects with their mates to test their size limits and discomfort thresh holds. We should get this thread rolling and share the basic information about our experiments. Just as a suggestion, we could post their height, age (range), whether or not they\u2019ve given birth vaginally, maybe their general responses to the penetration, and most importantly the sizes of the objects. My girl will allow me to give it a shot. I\u2019ll be posting the information in the next couple of days. We will just have to find the time to do it.\n\nAs for your findings, the length of the dildo may have played a role, even though most of her pleasure was received at her opening. We have to remeber that the legnth (time/duration) of the stroke is important even if she does not find anything special about deeper pressure. Also, I would suggest that you venture a little deeper with her next time. If she stated that \u201cyou still didn\u2019t put it completely into her\u201d, her maximum aroused vaginal depth is aparently a little beyond 7\u201d. Maybe you should use just as much caution and try to go into her cul de sac (follow the back wall of her vagina up behind her cervix into the posterior fornix). If you gradually put a little more pressure you will not hurt her. She\u2019ll just tell you that\u2019s enough. In my experience, it took a bit of pressure and would have probably compressed a soft dildo.\n\nFrom another perspective, which is still quite likely, you probably did slip behind the cervix with the dildo and began stilmulating her cul de sac a bit. You probably just didn\u2019t reach her limit though by an inch or two. She just comfirmed with you that lenght didn\u2019t matter. You may have just been within .5\u201d of her limit. You\u2019ll never know till you test it again. Also, it may change at different times of the month, and as most of you know it will be deepest at a woman\u2019s peak of arousal.\n\nStruggling with a peyronies injury during sex and loss of size after having been into PE.\n\n09-23-2003, 12:07 AM\n\nsunshinekid\n\nVRman,\n\nI moved this here as it is a more appropriate placement, IMO.\n\nHopefully you\u2019ll get good responses here.\n\nsunny A day without sunshine is like a day without laughter :sun:\n\n09-23-2003, 03:00 AM\n\navocet8\n\n1) You are thicker than most men so get over feeling deficient.\n\n2) Dildoes are not the best gauge for figuring out what pleasures a woman.

So what?\n\n4) Maybe ask her sometime if she prefers the dildo to you inside her.

I think you are very right. To complete the picture: my wife is 33 years old, 175 cm tall (I think that is 5\u20198\u201d), 70 kg, no kids. I did not want to penetrate her even further because I don\u2019t want her to think (/realize) that I am a little pervert being into deep penetration. *sigh*Maybe you are right that I missed only the half inch that made the difference. Problem is, it is hard to get her in the mood for dildos. We have been owning two large ones for years now, but we used them maybe 5 times.\n\n@ avocet\n\nThanks you for your kind words. You cheered me up! You are right, I should not underestimate the value of a kind, caring body attached to that thing in her. But getting scientific, the thing in her is the one that counts. But it is strange that I attribute to her what I would not accept about myself \u2014 valuing a plastic imitation over the real thing. I mean, if my wife used a rubber vagina to satisfy me, and afterwards would complain in a forum that she is not sufficient for me, I would feel misrepresented.\n\nIt might turn her on to think you see her as a sex object (also).

    "hts of many production boats WILL leak or even give out when hit the wrong way by a ton of water. The hull might survive, but if you are pooped and your plywood 1/4\" companionway drop boards shatter and let a ton of water below, you and your boat might suffer the death of a thousand splashes, so to speak. And again, who bails while you steer, check for chafe, adjust lines and keep a watch?\n\nLastly, there are certain calculation that can give an idea of how \"whippy\" a boat might be at sea. Some boats and skippers do fine, even with the caveats listed above, only to fall prey to persistent sea-sickness due to the rough, \"snap-rolls\" some fin keelers can produce. Either that or they can get injured when a boat falls off a wave or rolls 50 degrees and they break an arm.\n\nAll this is definitely worst-case scenario, but the trip you are proposing (counter the usual Gulf Stream current and with a shoal-surrounded destination) is among the more challenging you could tackle, certainly as a first solo trip.\n\nI would recommend trying to do deliveries on similarly sized fin keelers. Now is the perfect time of the year, as many cruisers in the Caribbean are heading north soon. At least if you are in a crew of four, you can take a break and know you've got backup of a presumed but likely level of competence.",
    "rsement for this book.\n\nLior was called to the police for investigation but refused to go. Now an arrest warrant has been issued against him. In both cases, it is not clear why a summons was necessary.\n\nThe texts have been published and it is possible to submit indictments against both Shapira and Lior. This means that Shai Nitzan, the prosecutor who ordered that Rabbi Shapira be arrested and shackled, knowing that there was no rationale for an indictment, intended to incite the public against him through the well-publicized arrest and the handcuffs. Obviously this is also his intention in the case of Rabbi Lior.\n\nThe summaries by Rabbi Shapira are based on the teachings of the greatest Torah sages, including Maimonides. Even though he dug up long-buried halakhot of this kind not merely to clarify religious law, as Kahanists are trying to make out, the problem must be dealt with in a public, educational and moral sphere and must not be handled by an aggressive prosecution that is biased, and that handcuffs people and punishes them without trial.\n\nThe zealots of the prosecution who in their stupidity dispatch policemen and arrest warrants to deal with the rabbis, force moderate rabbis who hold very different views from those of Lior and Shapira to stand by them.\n\nIn the midst of the suicide bombings, a respected secular teacher urged the terrorists, for fear that they would lose the support they were entitled to, to focus their suicide bombings on the settlers. He was not even called for interrogation.\n\nIn a state like this, which later went so far as to grant the Israel Prize to this inciter and agitator, the justice system has lost every moral basis for discussing the matter of Rabbis Shapira and Lior. This same country also did not bring to trial Azmi Bishara, who, even when he belonged to the academic world, justified and encouraged terrorism.\n\nThe Supreme Court which sent Rabbi Ido Elba to jail for writing things similar to those written by Rabbi Shapira, is forbidden to judge on matters of belief and opinions. The prosecutor responsible for preventing incitement, who did not take any steps against a key left-wing activist who wrote that it was permitted to commit terrorist acts against Israelis because they are occupiers, is precluded from dealing with this sensitive subject, and is not fit to do so, nor are his superiors who support him.\n\nThe affair concerning Dr. David Bukay of Haifa University, the only academic that has ever been summoned for interrogation on suspicion of incitement \u200f(for the insults he supposedly hurled at Arab students\u200f) characterizes more than any other the selective political conduct of Nitzan. Even after all the investigations proved that the claims against Bukay were false, Nitzan continued to chase after him and instructed the police to call him in once more.\n\nBukay complained to the State Comptroller. \u201cWe found,\u201d the comptroller\u2019s office replied, \u201cyour complaint about the instructions by advocate Shai Nitzan to be justified. The ombudsman has made known the findings of the investigation to the state prosecution.\u201d So he knows.\n\nThe Arab street in Israel is filled with written publications that include words of incitement against the Jews. From the minarets, muezzins and imams incite their people to kill the Jews who defile the al-Aqsa Mosque and desecrate the holy Islamic ground.\n\nThis incitement takes place in Galilee, the Negev, the Triangle, Wadi Ara, Jaffa and Jerusalem. However Nitzan does not pay attention to these acts of incitement.\n\nPerhaps because the Arabs are correct. Or perhaps because he will immediately be confronted by the various civil rights organizations that will cry foul. And perhaps because the High Court of Justice, as is its wont, will come out in support of freedom of expression. And perhaps because he will no longer find favor in the eyes of his milieu.\n\nWho knows? In the Jewish state, so it seems, the only incitement that is permitted is that against the Jews.\n\u201cTorat Hamelech\u201d and similar publications are not a matter of concern for the prosecution. First and foremost they are a matter for the religious public, the vast majority of which \u2212 including most of the rabbis \u2212 is opposed to the application of those religious laws that were quoted by Rabbi Shapira.\n\nBut that is not sufficient. The rabbis and the public figures must have the courage to declare that religious laws of this kind must cease to exist. To these must be added also those religious laws which discriminate against women, which boycott gays, and which prevent minorities from getting equal rights. In the world of morals and values of today, it is not sufficient to bypass them \u2212 they must be declared null and void. It is only when this public gets together and decides that the validity of outdated religious laws is now totally revoked, will there be a possibility of instigating a real religious renaissance. And this is true not merely in the sphere of capital cases.\n\nThis is the theological and moral test for those who reject \u201cTorat Hamelech.\u201d This is one of the central challenges facing religious Zionism.",
    "eement between the Defendant, Plaintiff's former employer, and the Utility Workers of America, Local 262, Plaintiff's union. Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act gives federal court subject matter jurisdiction over claims governed by collective bargaining agreements.\nOn August 21, 1987, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff filed a brief in opposition to the Defendant's motion, and Defendant filed a reply brief on October 22, 1987. For the reasons that follow, we will grant the Defendant's motion to dismiss this complaint and order that the Clerk of Courts close this case.\n\nFacts\nPlaintiff was an employee of the Defendant at its Kingston, Pennsylvania facility from approximately 1980 to his termination on August 14, 1986. During that time, the Plaintiff performed various duties as a custodial worker and coal handler, and most recently, as a mechanic. Plaintiff states that on July 31, 1986 he was injured at work when he attempted to lift a trap door from a scale. Plaintiff claims that agents of the Defendant interfered with his attempt to arrange and keep a medical appointment in the days following his injury. Moreover, the Defendant allegedly demanded that Plaintiff sign a document related to previous unexcused absences from employment. Plaintiff argues that these demands were calculated to chill the Plaintiff's attempt to seek medical attention for his injuries as well as convey to the Plaintiff that his job was in jeopardy for any future absences which the company deem meritless. It appears that the Plaintiff refused to sign the company documents. As a result, the Defendant, on August 14, 1986, terminated the Plaintiff's employment on the grounds of insubordination.\nPlaintiff currently avers that the Defendant used this \"signing requirement\" only to create a false controversy so that Defendant could terminate the Plaintiff's employment.\nPlaintiff maintains that he was wrongfully discharged contrary to the public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; that the Defendant acted with specific intent to harm him; that the Defendant slandered him; and that they inflicted emotional distress upon him.\nDefendant argues in its motion to dismiss that the Plaintiff's claims are governed by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and are preempted by federal law \u0097 specifically, Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. The Defendant further indicates that even were we to recharacterize Plaintiff's claims as brought under Section 301 of the Labor Management and Relations Act, we would nevertheless be required to dismiss this case because plaintiff does not aver that the union failed to properly prosecute his grievance.\n\n\n*1141 ANALYSIS\nThis case turns on the question of whether the Plaintiff has raised state law claims sufficiently distinct from the collective bargaining agreement so that those claims would not be preempted by Sections 301 of the Labor Management and Relations Act (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185). The Defendant argues in its motion to dismiss that although the Plaintiff attempts to aver state tort law causes of action for wrongful discharge, slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, in reality Plaintiff's claims are governed by the collective bargaining agreement between the Defendant and the Plaintiff's union. Defendant argues that the determination of whether the Plaintiff's termination was wrongful or unjust would necessarily require an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. Defendant states:\nThe gist of Plaintiff's complaint is a claim for relief due to UGI allegedly tortious behavior in accusing Plaintiff of too many unexcused absences and in creating \"controversy and confrontations with the Plaintiff as a contrived justification to terminate\" his employment by requiring him to sign certain documents. Complaint, \u00b6 8. Clearly, the signing requirement, the number of unexcused absences permitted, and the whole question of whether Plaintiff was wrongfully discharged, are all issues that must be examined through an interpretation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Furthermore, and in addition to Plaintiff's \"violation of public policy\" contentions in Count I, Plaintiff's allegations as to Counts II, III, and IV regarding specific intent to harm, defamation, and infliction of emotional stress all referred to, and are intertwined with, the circumstances surrounding his termination.\nDocument 6 at pp. 8 and 9.\nDefendant further points out that the parties, when entering into the collective bargaining agreement, foresaw that various disputes, such as this, would occur. Accordingly, the parties incorporated specific provisions relating to discharge, and provided for specific mandatory and binding grievance and arbitration procedures for all disputes or disagreements arising out of the application of the collective bargaining agreement. By virtue of these facts, Defendant maintains that the instant complaint is governed by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and are either preempted by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, or the complaint represents a single claim for a federal remedy under \u00a7 301 which fails to state a claim as a matter of law.\nIn response, the Plaintiff points out that not every state law suit asserting a right that relates in some way to a provision in the collective bargaining agreement necessarily is preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. Plaintiff relies on two cases with arguably similar fact patterns to bolster his assertion that the instant claims are not preempted by \u00a7 301.\nSpecifically, the Plaintiff relies on two decisions that allowed for a wrongful discharge action where there existed state statutes precluding employers from discharging or discriminating against both \"union\" and \"at will\" employees because the employees sought to exercise their Workmen's Compensation rights. For instance, in Herring v. Prince Macaroni of New Jersey, Inc., 799 F.2d 120 (3d Cir. 1986), our Third Circuit predicted that with respect to discharges in retaliation for filing Workmen's Compensation claims, the New Jersey Supreme Court would extend an individual right of action for damages to contractual employees covered by \"just cause\" clauses. The court found that where the legislature had declared an employment practice unlawful as to all employees, and the New Jersey courts have recognized an action at law to enforce that declaration, it would be unlikely for union employees to be relegated to only the remedies provided for under the collective bargaining agreement for such violations.\nSimilarly, the Court in Baldracchi v. Pratt & Whitney, 814 F.2d 102 (2d Cir. 1987) was confronted with an employee's action under a Connecticut statute which prohibited employers from discharging an *1142 employee for filing a claim for Workmen's Compensation benefits. The statute further provided civil remedies for violation of the statute and indicated that no labor contract would relieve an employer of any obligation created by the statute. The Court held that such a statute applied both to union employees as well as employees at will and, accordingly, the statute provided rights independent of the collective bargaining agreement which were not preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management and Relations Act.\nDefendant asserts, however, that the cases relied upon by the Plaintiff are not applicable in the instant situation. Defendant maintains that the aforementioned decisions were based on the provisions of state statutes which specifically provided both union employees and employees at will with a cause of action for wrongful discharge when the employee is terminated for exercising his Workmen's Compensation rights; yet no such statute exists in Pennsylvania. Defendant points out that on the contrary, the Pennsylvania Superior Court recently held that a union employee may not maintain an action for the tort of wrongful discharge under circumstances similar to those in the instant case.\nIn Phillips v. Babcock and Wilcox, 349 Pa.Super. 351, 503 A.2d 36 (1986) app. denied, 513 Pa. 641 (1987), a union employee filed a claim in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County alleging that he was discharged in retaliation for filing a Workmen's Compensation claim. The Superior Court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer, holding that an action for the tort of wrongful discharge is available only when the employment relationship is at will. The Court stated:\nAppellant seeks to have us extend the coverage of this judicially created protection [i.e., a wrongful discharge claim] and declare the cause of action available to union employees who are otherwise protected from wrongful discharge by collective bargaining agreements. Appellant advances his position on the assumption that the intent behind the development of the cause of action was to uphold public policy and provide a remedy to those who were injured by an employer's disregard of such policy. However, the wrongful discharge cause of action was never intended to provide a forum to vindicate public policy and punish those who deviate from it....\n... the Court's purpose was to provide a remedy for employees with no other recourse against wrongful discharge.\nAppellant and all like situated employees are not without recourse when faced with indiscriminate discharge even when the discharge violates public policy. The collective bargaining agreement in the instant case provides protection against suspension or discharge without \"proper cause.\" Surely, in pursuing a grievance under the provisions of the agreement, if appellant can show that his discharge was in retaliation for his filing a Workmen's Compensation claim, he will have proved that his discharge was not for \"proper cause.\" It would appear, therefore, that appellant will then be entitled to the remedies provided in the agreement. ...\n... Finally, in deciding not to extend the wrongful discharge action to employees who are otherwise protected by contract or statute, we must take into consideration the strong public policy which favors the right of parties to enter into contracts. In the instant case, the union and appellee in their agreement decided the remedies that would be available, and provided that those remedies would be final and binding. This intent is expressly set forth in the agreement and, therefore, the remedies available should be preclusive of any others. Aughenbaugh v. North American Refractories Company, 426 Pa. 211 [231 A.2d 173] (1967). Therefore, because the wrongful discharge action in Pennsylvania was judicially created to protect otherwise unprotected employees from indiscriminate discharge and to provide unorganized workers a legal redress against improper action by their employers, we hold that an action for the tort of wrongful discharge is available only when the employment relationship is at will.\n*1143 Phillips v. Babcock & Wilcox, supra, 349 Pa.Super. at 353-355, 503 A.2d 36.\nThe Phillips case makes it clear that a Pennsylvania tort action for wrongful discharge is available only when the employment relationship is at will, and directs a union employee to the protections afforded him under the grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement to remedy any wrongs.\nWhen resolution of a state-law claim is substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of an agreement made between the parties in a labor contract, the claim must either be treated as a \u00a7 301 claim or dismissed as preempted by federal labor-contract law. Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985).\nAs such, \u00a7 301 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, provides the exclusive remedy where a Pennsylvania employer wrongfully discharges a union employee against public policy, and Pennsylvania state tort claims of this sort are preempted by this section. Additionally, each of the claims arising out of and relating to the circumstances surrounding the Plaintiff's discharge are similarly preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management and Relations Act. Thus, Plaintiff allegations that he suffered severe emotional distress as a result of his termination and was slandered by statements made by Defendant's agents against him during the events surrounding his discharge are necessarily preempted by \u00a7 301 as they all relate to and are inextricably intertwined with the question of whether the Defendant properly discharged the Plaintiff. See Farmer v. Carpenter Local 25, 430 U.S. 290, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 51 L.Ed.2d 338 (1977); Peoples v. Pa. Power & Light Company, 638 F.Supp. 402 (M.D.Pa.1985); Seid v. Pacific Bell, Inc., 635 F.Supp. 906 (S.D.Cal. 1985).\nIn our having made this finding, the Supreme Court in Allis-Chalmers, supra, directs us to either dismiss the complaint as preempted by \u00a7 301 or to recharacterize this action as a \u00a7 301 claim.\nGenerally, no employee protected by a collective bargaining agreement can sue the employer except after pursuing his grievance remedies under the contract, and either obtaining successful judicial review of the arbitration award, or establishing that his right of fair representation was violated. See Costello v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 617 F.Supp. 123 (E.D.Pa. 1984). In the instant case, the Plaintiff makes it clear in his brief in opposition to the Defendant's motion that he has averred no distinct violation of the collective bargaining agreement. The Plaintiff has seemingly closed the door to this Court allowing the case to proceed as a claim under \u00a7 301 by asserting that his tort claims are distinct and have nothing to do with the collective bargaining agreement.\nEven were we to recharacterize the Plaintiff's claims as \u00a7 301 claim, we agree with the Defendants that we would be required to dismiss the Plaintiff's claims. As the Court held in Krushinski v. Roadway Express, Inc., 627 F.Supp. 934, 938 (M.D. Pa.1985), an employee protected by a collective bargaining agreement may sue his employer only after he has pursued the grievance remedies provided by the contract, and he establishes that his right of fair representation was violated. See also Vosch v. Werner Continental, Inc., 734 F.2d 149 (3d Cir.1984). In the instant case, Plaintiff never alleges in his complaint that the union to fail to properly prosecute a grievance on his behalf, nor has the Plaintiff even alleged that he pursued the grievance remedies set forth in the collective bargaining agreement.[1]\nIn light of the foregoing, the Defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint will be granted.\nNOTES\n[1]  Our review of this file, however, does in fact make it clear that the Plaintiff filed a grievance upon his termination.

    "the teeth. Once the brackets are affixed to the patient's teeth, such as by means of glue or cement, a curved arch wire is inserted into the slot of each bracket. The arch wire acts as a template or track to guide movement of the teeth into proper alignment.\nThere are two distinct classes of orthodontic brackets: those that require the use of ligatures to fasten the arch wire to the bracket, and those that are self-ligating. In brackets of the first class, small ligature wires or elastics are typically used to hold the arch wire in a securely seated position in the brackets. Ligatures or some other form of fastening means are essential to ensure that the tensioned arch wire is properly positioned around the dental arch, and to prevent the wire from being dislodged from the bracket slots during chewing of food, brushing of teeth, or application of other forces. One type of commercially available ligature is a small, elastomeric O-ring, which is installed by stretching the O-ring around small wings known as \u201ctie wings\u201d that are connected to the bracket body. Metal ligatures are also used to retain arch wires within the bracket slots.\nIn an effort to simplify the process of installing braces, a variety of self-ligating brackets have been developed. The term \u201cself-ligating bracket\u201d refers to a class of orthodontic brackets that include some sort of cover, whether separate from, hingedly or otherwise attached to the base, which encloses or otherwise retains the arch wire within the slot of the base.\nIn either case, there is a need during treatment to apply various corrective forces to the teeth during treatment. Arch wires having different cross-sectional configurations are typically used to apply different forces, depending on the corrective movement to be achieved. Arch wires typically have either a square, rectangular, or round cross-section. Square and rectangular cross-sections allow the arch wire to be used to apply a torquing force when engaged in an arch wire slot of an orthodontic bracket. Torquing forces provide for tooth movement in the labial and/or lingual directions. Although a wire having a round cross-section does not allow application of torquing forces when engaged within an arch wire slot, it does provide a greater degree of flexibility and generally requires less force to effect movement, which is more comfortable for the patient. As such, round wires are often useful during the beginning stages of orthodontic treatment when the teeth are most malaligned. Use of such a round arch wire allows for movement of teeth to correct spacing and alignment issues with relatively light (and more comfortable) forces. Once these corrections have been achieved, a square or rectangular wire typically replaces the round arch wire, so as to allow torquing of selected teeth to complete the treatment.\nAs such, treatment often progresses in a series fashion, in which spacing and alignment issues are first addressed, and tooth movement in the labial and/or lingual directions is addressed afterwards. Although such treatment regimes work, they can take several months to complete. As such, it would be an improvement in the art to provide an orthodontic bracket which could be easily manufactured, and which would include a mechanism for allowing application of relatively light forces (i.e., similar to those applied by a round arch wire), but which forces are also capable of applying a corrective torquing force. Such a bracket would be expected to provide movement of teeth to correct spacing and alignment with light forces, while simultaneously providing torquing movements, which would provide for faster overall treatment times, while also providing increased comfort for the patient during torquing correction.",

BMW vehicle sales in the United States rose by 14 percent last year including the Mini brand; sales of Daimler's Mercedes and Smart brands increased more than 15 percent; and Volkswagen's U.S. sales soared 34 percent, including Audi brand cars.\n\nThe renaissance of U.S. demand has prompted some companies and governments to re-examine their priorities, and helps explain why EU leaders have been pushing hard for a new European-U.S. trade agreement.

IOW, two that have never been assigned together should be the first item in the ordered list, while those that have been assigned together the most times should be at the bottom.\nNote: someone who appears as a \"StudentID_FK\" one time will likely be represented as an \"AssistantID_FK\" the next time, and vice versa.\nTo determine this, the entire json file will need to be queried. I believe I could get the count something like this (assuming studentlist is a list of students, as represented in the json file):\nint countOfTimesWorkedTogether = GetCountOfTimesWorkedTogether(student1, student2);\n\nprivate int GetCountOfTimesWorkedTogether(int student, int assistant)\n{\n    int StudentAndAssistant = studentlist.Where(s => s.StudentID_FK == student && a => a.AssistantID_FK == assistant).Count();\n    int AssistantAndStudent = studentlist.Where(s => s.StudentID_FK == assistant && a => a.AssistantID_FK == student).Count();\n    return StudentAndAssistant + AssistantAndStudent;\n}\n\n...but then how would I use that in a LINQ query of the list? The count is not a member of the student class, so what \"trick\" could be employed to order the results based on these counts?\nWhat I need is two side-by-side orderings from the same list. The first one to be ordered by WeekOfAssignment, and the one \"beside it\" to contain a list of other people, ordered by the fewest times they have worked with the person currently highlighted in the checkedlistbox that is populated from that first query.\nIn pseudocode, what I need to end up with is:\nList<Student> orderedStudents = studentlist.OrderBy(WeekOfAssignment);\n\nThat populates checklistboxStudents.\nThen this:\nList<Student> orderedAssistants = studentlist.OrderBy(CountOfTimesWorkedWithSelectedPersonInChecklistboxStudents);\n\n...populates checklistboxAssistants; so this second query would have to be rerun, and checklistboxAssistants reordered, each time a different student was selected in checklistboxStudents.\nUPDATE\nI'm afraid I didn't explain clearly the true nature of this problem. It is:\nThere are, each week, a number (3) of assignments that requires two students each: \"the\" student, and an assistant.\nEach student can play any role; they can give talk 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. The even-numbered are the Student assignments, and the odd-numbered are the Assistant assignments. Each list is unique - those that are slated to be assigned #2 next, those that are slated to be assigned #3 next, etc.\nSo each of the six lists are a unique subset of the superset list of students, with approximately 1/6th of the total number in each list on any given week (they move to the next list the following week).\nAnd so I need to compare those in list 3 with those in list 2, those in list 5 with those in list 4, and those in list 7 with the ones in list 6.\nThere is a Students list which keeps track of student data, such as last assignment given (both the #/talk type and the date), etc. The Assignments list (an excerpt of which is shown above) contains, for each assignment/week, the student who was \"the\" student (StudentID_FK), and the student who was the Assistant on that occaison (AssistantID_FK).\nSo, rethinking it, I might be able to do order the assistants something like this (pseudocode):\n0) Add an \"OptionalOrderingVal\" member to the Students class:\npublic int OptionalOrderingVal { get; set; }\n\nFirst, get the intial Assistant list based on next assignment type, ordered by last assignment date; for example, for assignment #3, which supports #2:\nvar RVAssistantsList = studentlist.Where(t => t.talkType == 3).OrderBy(w => weekOfLastAssignment);\n\nNext, create a new version of that sublist, populating the OptionalOrderingVal member:\nint countOfAssignmentsWithStudent = 0;\nint StudentId = comboboxRVStudent.SelectedValue;\nforeach (Student assistant in RVAssistantsList)\n{\n    countOfAssignmentsWithStudent = assignmentsList.Where(StudentID_FK == StudentId && AssistantID_FK == AssistantId || StudentID_FK == AssistantId && AssistantID_FK == StudentId);\n    assistant.OptionalOrderingVal = countOfAssignmentsWithStudent;\n}\n\nThen, order the assistant list by the new value:\nRVAssistantsList = RVAssistantsList\n    .OrderBy(o => o.OptionalOrderingVal)\n    .ThenBy(w => w.WeekOfLastAssignment)\n    .ToList();\n\nFinally, assign that list to the appropriate checklistbox:\nchecklistboxRVAssistants.Items = RVAssistantsList;\n\nI could call this either kludgelent or eligy; YMMV.\n\nA:\n\nIf you have a model like this:\npublic class Student\n{\n    public DateTime WeekOfAssignment { get; set; }\n    public int TalkType { get; set; }\n    public int StudentID_FK { get; set; }\n    public int AssistantID_FK { get; set; }\n    public int CounselPoint { get; set; }\n    public bool HasBeenEmailed { get; set; }\n    public bool SlipHasBeenPrinted { get; set; }\n}\n\nYou can make a linq query grouping by properties StudentID_FK and AssistantID_FK using an anonymous type and order this groups according to its size, then joins the elements again. \nThis sort the elements according how many times the pair StudentID_FK and AssistantID_FK appears in the list, lowest times first:\nvar result = studentlist.GroupBy(m => new \n                                { \n                                    A = Math.Min(m.StudentID_FK, m.AssistantID_FK),  // This gets pairs like (1, 2) and (2, 1)\n                                    B = Math.Max(m.StudentID_FK, m.AssistantID_FK)   // as the same (1, 2)\n                                })\n                    .OrderBy(g => g.Count())\n                    .SelectMany(g => g)\n                    .ToList();\n\n",

    " for organisations that are ready to engage with the cyber war, \u201cthat has only just started\u201d. The final line is particularly glowing, noting (quite rightly) that most cyber attacks are merely grabbing low-hanging fruit, and that Perception, \u201cmoves the network away from this category and beyond\u201d.\n\nThe full review contains impressive insights into the benefits of proactive security, and is definitely worth a read if you have the time.\n\nPerception was originally developed by Chemring Technology Solutions for the UK Ministry of Defence. Complementing existing computer network security systems, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software, Perception is a behavioural analysis system with no rigid rules-based architecture.\n\nThe award was presented at a banquet in London's Royal Garden Hotel\n\nDhiraj Badgujar, Analyst at Frost & Sullivan, said: \"The increasing complexity of network security is becoming difficult for businesses to manage, leading to mistakes or gaps for attackers to exploit. With its deep learning capability and the ability to adapt based on changing network behaviours, Perception will enable enterprises to identify future advanced threats before they emerge.\"\n\nThe major differentiating factors of Perception are its ability to identify malicious activity without requiring prior knowledge of the threat, as well as alerting the user to potential vulnerabilities so they can be resolved before an attacker exploits them. This makes it more difficult for malware to evade detection and easier for analysts to proactively detect network vulnerabilities and user error.\n\nAs well as detecting threats and vulnerabilities as they happen, Perception uses artificial intelligence (AI) to intelligently interlink network events across months, weeks, and minutes, enabling large-volume data pattern analysis. This significantly improves \"low and slow\" threat detection capabilities, in addition to providing a low false alarm rate. Perception also detects the slow, unauthorised external extraction of information from the network, even when sophisticated obfuscation techniques are used.\n\nDaniel Driver, Head of Perception Cyber Security, said: \"Based on declassified work for national security agencies, Perception takes the fight against cybercrime to a new level. An award from the respected international analyst firm Frost & Sullivan's gives us an unbiased, third-party stamp of approval. The Perception development team truly deserved to be recognised in this way as it proves to us that we have created something truly unique in identifying advanced cyber threats.\"\n\nFor the New Product Innovation Award, Frost & Sullivan analysts followed a 10-step evaluation process to assess Perception's fit against best practice criteria, focusing on two key factors - New Product Attributes and Customer Impact.\n\nAbout Frost & Sullivan\n\nFrost & Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants. For more than 50 years, we have been developing growth strategies for the global 1000, emerging businesses, the public sector, and the investment community.\n\nThe Spanish Guardia Civil has chosen Chemring Technology Solutions\u2019 Perception Cyber Security to protect its critical network assets from cyber-attacks, as well identify malicious insiders or other vulnerabilities within the network. The new contract follows a successful product evaluation by Perception and its Spanish partner Eleycon21.\n\nPerception was originally developed for the UK Ministry of Defence and is the world\u2019s first bio-inspired network security system. Once deployed, Perception will complement the Guardia Civil\u2019s existing computer network security systems by identifying the potential threats they cannot.\n\nEleycon21 distribute and support the Perception product throughout Spain. Gabriel Crespo, Managing Director of Eleycon21, said: \u201cPerception offers a ground-breaking approach to identifying advanced cyber threats and it will deliver the Guardia Civil a distinct advantage. We are therefore delighted to be partnering Perception Cyber Security in the delivery and support of its technology in Spain.\u201d\n\nAs Perception is a network behaviour analysis system, it has no rigid \u201crules-based\u201d architecture and adapts to the network\u2019s changing profile to automatically identify malicious activity, making it more difficult for malware to evade detection. It will also detect the slow, unauthorised external extraction of information from the network, even when sophisticated obfuscation techniques are used.\n\nDaniel Driver, Head of Perception Cyber Security, said: \u201cEleycon21 has an in-depth knowledge of the dangers posed by today\u2019s more sophisticated network security threats, and they are committed to ensuring that Spain\u2019s leading organisations have the robust cyber protection required to combat them. Their work alongside Guardia Civil in deploying Perception is a demonstration of their commitment to this endeavour and we are delighted to support them.\u201d\n\nBefore we start, Microsoft have released an emergency patch for unsupported versions of Windows (XP, 2003, Vista, 2008) here and in March Microsoft released a patch for supported versions of Windows that stops the exploit used in the WannaCrypt attacks, details here\n\nWannaCrypt\n\nEverything you need to know\n\nWannaCrypt (aka WannaCrypt0r, WannaCry, Wcry) is a type of ransomware that proliferated very rapidly, with reports that it had affected several high-profile organisations as of 12th May. Put simply, ransomware is an attack that encrypts files on a machine so they can\u2019t be used, then demands a ransom be paid for them to be decrypted. These types of attacks are common, but this month\u2019s attacks in particular are noteworthy for a number of reasons.\n\nTypically ransomware is what\u2019s known as a Trojan, delivered via email, requiring hundreds of thousands (or potentially millions) of malicious phishing emails to be sent with attachments or links, and affecting those unfortunate enough to open the attachment or link. WannaCrypt had an additional capability, a self-replicating payload (known as a worm) that meant that once it was in a network, it was able to propagate to other machines on that network. In action, this meant that it only took one person in a business to be affected before everyone in that business was also affected. The worm also has the ability to self-replicate to other networks via the internet, depending on that network\u2019s configuration.\n\nThere are multiple conflicting reports on whether WannaCrypt was delivered via email or another method, however, the large impact on businesses was largely caused by the self-propagating addition to the ransomware since several machines could be taken out of action if only one machine was initially infected.\n\nThe self-propagating fragment of the ransomware uses a vulnerability that was discovered by the US National Security Agency who also developed an associated exploit. We do not know how long they knew about the vulnerability, but unlike security researchers the NSA tend to keep newly discovered exploits to themselves in order to use them for intelligence activities. The particular exploit used by WannaCrypt was used internally as part of a toolkit codenamed \u2018EternalBlue\u2019. Last year the NSA themselves were hacked by a group called the ShadowBrokers, who released details of EternalBlue to the public in April, which is why we are now seeing malicious attacks using the same methods.\n\nWannaCrypt can affect all unpatched versions of Windows from XP to Windows 8. Microsoft had patched the vulnerabilities exposed by EternalBlue in March before the exploit was publically released by ShadowBrokers and in the wake of the attack Microsoft released patches for unsupported versions of Windows (this is rare for Microsoft to patch older versions of Windows, but they did so due to the large scale impact of the WannaCrypt attacks).\n\nMultiple organisations were affected by the attack, however it is not yet known (and unlikely we\u2019ll ever know) if these were targeted directly or just randomly happened to be affected. These include Telefonica in Spain, Fedex in the US and the NHS in the UK to name but a few. Remediation and disaster recovery strategies were put in place in affected businesses, such as turning off all IT equipment and rolling back to pre-attack backups, actions which were hugely costly to those affected and may result in a loss of data in the organisation that may not be identified immediately.\n\nAs WannaCrypt started to spread uncontrollably, cyber security researchers started digging into the malware to see how it worked. One of these researchers, MalwareTech, noticed that WannaCrypt contacts an external website before activating on a victim machine, however, when they looked to see who owned this domain it was unregistered. They thought it would be useful to register this domain so they could understand how many connections it was receiving and consequently be able to estimate how many machines were being affected by WannaCrypt. In an odd turn of events, WannaCrypt stops running if the domain has been registered when the malware starts running, therefore stopping the malware activating on internet-connected devices that were subsequently hit by it. There\u2019s many reasons for putting this \u2018killswitch\u2019 mechanism in malware, the leading theory is that it\u2019s a way of understanding if the machine it\u2019s affecting is being used in a test environment. Since these test environments seldom have internet connections for security reasons, the malware is able to hide from the tests by not activating if there\u2019s no external internet connection. By registering this domain MalwareTech may have vastly reduced the infection rate of the initial version of the malware.\n\nThat\u2019s not likely the end of the story for WannaCrypt, in the weeks since the initial infections were identified, variations with alternative killswitches have been created, and there\u2019s even some variations with the killswitch removed entirely. In essence, WannaCrypt is a combination of two attacks, Ransomware and a self-replicating worm; both of these attacks will continue to be produced by malicious actors.\n\nSo what can we do to stop these types of attacks going forward? It goes without saying that good security procedures need to be adhered to, keep updating software as soon as possible and make sure not to open links or attachments we weren't expecting to receive. From a business perspective the same advice applies but in situations where older software must be used, for example to control systems that have lifespans of several decades, a method must be in place to identify these vulnerabilities and put protections in place to stop them being attacked. Tools such as Perception can identify vulnerabilities on a network before they are attacked, giving businesses the chance to protect themselves where software updates aren\u2019t possible. If the worst does happen, these types of network monitoring tools can alert an analyst to exactly which files have been encrypted, and which hosts have been affected, assisting greatly in remediation activities.\n\nThe BBC consumer advice show, \u201cWatchdog\u201d found hundreds of examples of customers being billed for food that they didn\u2019t order via the restaurant delivery app Deliveroo, forcing the foodies-favourite business to deny that is has been targeted by hackers. The company claimed that the fraudulent orders were made using credentials stolen in other attacks, and only worked on customers that used the same email/password combination for their Deliveroo account.\n\nThe customers contacted by the programme, which aired on the 23rd November (you can watch it on iPlayer here until the 23rd December if you are in the UK) all had their money refunded, which is good news, but we don\u2019t know how much has had to be forked out in refunds to affected customers. Deliveroo have since denied that any payment information had been taken, and the transactions were made using a one-click style payment process that doesn\u2019t require customers to input their payment information again for every order.\n\nThe advice remains that any online accounts should be protected by a unique password. Although this can rapidly become unmanageable, several password managers are available to stop you forgetting unique passwords for that one website you only use once a year and you\u2019re never going to remember. Apple users can use iCloud keychain, although cross-application support is often lacking, and several Perception staff members use and can vouch for 1Password.\n\nThe use of stolen credentials raises an interesting issue for businesses online. Deliveroo obviously benefits from a massively streamlined ordering process, however, is this done to the detriment of security? Deliveroo have stated they will ask for verification when orders are made to new addresses, which should help to stop the fraud entirely (although it still leaves doors open to send as much food as possible to a hacked customer's genuine address in the weirdest hacking prank ever). If Deliveroo is able to prove where the passwords were stolen from, should they be able to make a claim against that organisation since it was technically their fault? Should every breached company be forced to immediately contact all customers and let them know a single password is no longer usable on any other sites?\n\nThe European Banking Authority plans to regulate two-factor authentication on all orders over \u20ac10 in the near future, but already that has many businesses favouring one-click ordering up in arms stating more business will be lost than the savings made on fraud refunds. Perhaps the responsibility of security lies solely with the consumers themselves, those that reuse passwords only having themselves to blame; we can hardly expect businesses to check all new accounts against haveibeenpwned.com and refusing service to those that have been hacked in the past, can we?\n\nSecurity experts have disclosed 3 vulnerabilities in Samsung Knox, a piece of software deployed on phones to separate personal and professional data for security purposes, according to Wired.\n\nThe Israeli security firm Viral Security Group exposed the flaws on a Samsung Galaxy S6 and a Galaxy Note 5, which allowed full control of each device. Considering the purpose of the software is to maintain the security of a business issued handset whilst allowing the flexibility of a personal device, the businesses that deploy this system may be assuming that these devices are safe despite moving between internal and external (protected and unprotected) network connections.\n\nIt's important to note that these vulnerabilities have since been patched in a security update, however, before the patch the researchers at Viral Security Group were able to replace legitimate applications with rogue versions, with access to all available permissions, without the user's notice. Many businesses rely on the Knox software to make sure any connection to a business network is made from the \"safe zone\" of the phone, and once outside of it's protective environment the personal segment of the phone is used. If movement between these two parts of the device's software is breached the protections are essentially useless and the device once again becomes a BYOD-type threat.\n\nThe take-away from this all is that you can't assume your security measures are foolproof, once protections are put in place, a significant responsibility still lies with understanding, controlling, and analysing network traffic.\n\nThe full white paper describing the flaws is well worth a read if you have time, but first make sure any devices on your network have fully up to date software.\n\nThe attack that resulted in Bangladesh Bank losing $81 million (and nearly losing a further $850 million and $870 million in a foiled later attempt) has also affected other banks, Reuters reports.\n\nAccording to the new information, SWIFT has sent messages to banks around the world of new breaches, but doesn't specify to what magnitude these breaches occurred. It has, however, suggested that banks increase their security, and to stay particularly vigilant of activity via the SWIFT system. The message later stated that, \"The threat is persistent, adaptive, and sophisticated - and it is here to stay.\"\n\nThe original attack on Bangladesh bank used the SWIFT messaging system to transfer funds away from the bank, using malware on the bank's SWIFT terminals. The original injection was via a network switch, and SWIFT have since stated that this switch and other use of legacy networking gear that was to blame, rather than SWIFT itself.\n\nThe new victims all shared one thing in common: Weaknesses in local security that attackers exploited to compromise local networks. SWIFT has responded with security updates to it's software, but if local security is still lax, and banks don't upgrade to the new software (they have no obligation to), then these attacks may keep occurring.\n\nWith so much money on the line, we may see financial institutions deploying more network security tools, and upgrading their switches, in the next few weeks.\n\nPerception is currently looking to hire two new people to join a rapidly growing business area with the feel of a start-up and the support of a multinational defence company. Both of these positions are based at our Roke Manor site, set in the Hampshire countryside just outside of Romsey, containing some of the most beautiful scenery for any workplace in the country, as well as facilities such as a full gym, tennis courts, cricket field, bar, restaurant, coffee shops, and a snooker room.\n\nIf you're interested in working in the world of cyber security, take a look at the roles below.\n\nDeveloper/Analyst\n\nThis is an exciting opportunity to join a strong team of developers and analysts and be involved in both the development of the platform and the analysis of the output from live deployments. You'll be working on analysis of live networks, as well as development of analyst-focused features in the product itself. The role requires an understanding of networking technologies and protocols combined with software development skills.\n\nThe necessary skills for this role are:\n\nProgramming skills - focusing on Java and third party library support, as well as some knowledge of scripting languages such as Python\n\nIT skills - Experience working with Linux, web servers, and SQL databases\n\nDeveloper (UI focus)\n\nThis is an exciting opportunity to join a strong team of developers and be involved in both the design of the interface as well as the underlying functions. You'll be working on the whole life cycle of UI development, from initial scoping with feedback from analysts and customers, through to feature design and implementation. The role requires an understanding of web design using HTML, Javascript (including frameworks such as JQuery and Bootstrap), CSS, and PHP, and appreciation for UI and UX design.\n\nEmergency services technology specialist j3llyh34d 1ndu5tr135 (\"Jellyhead\") has signed a deal with Chemring Technology Solutions to become a value added reseller for Perception Cyber Security .\n\nj3llyh34d currently provides cyber security services to several UK police and fire services, and Perception will complement its customers' existing computer network security systems by identifying the potential threats they cannot.\n\nSimon Twigg, Managing Director at j3llyh34d, said: \"Perception is a revolutionary approach to dealing with advanced threats such as zero-day vulnerabilities, targeted vectors and blackmarket rootkits, as well as information leakage. We are delighted to partner Chemring Technology Solutions in the delivery and support of this game-changing technology. Perception is the first security solution we have seen that gives the good guys a sustainable advantage over the bad guys. We believe the security landscape will be profoundly and irreversibly changed by this lateral approach.\"\n\nAs Perception is behavioural it has no rigid \"rules-based\" architecture and adapts to the network's changing profile to automatically identify malicious activity, making it more difficult for malware to evade detection. It will also detect the slow, unauthorised external extraction of information from the network, even when sophisticated obfuscation techniques are used to evade traditional rule-based security defences.\n\nDaniel Driver, Head of Perception Cyber Security at Chemring Technology Solutions, said: \"j3llyh34d have proven their in-depth knowledge of a very technical area, and share our passion for solving some of the toughest problems in cybersecurity today. We believe they have the capacity and the knowledge base to provide significant value to their customers using the power of the Perception technology.\"\n\nLast week's data breach from the accountancy and payroll software firm Sage seems to have come from a malicious insider, if the arrest of a company employee at Heathrow airport is anything to go by.\n\nWhilst it is still unclear what information may have been leaked, Sage started notifying the affected customers earlier in the month that some of their information, possibly including names, addresses, and bank account details, may have been compromised. Exact numbers of affected companies and individuals remain unknown, but 280 businesses are thought to have had personal information of their employees compromised.\n\nThe first thought for anyone in network security naturally goes to asking themselves the question, \"how can I stop this from happening to me?\" Whereas firewalls and endpoint protection can protect against malicious software and human-borne policy breaches, little protection exists against an employee with access to sensitive data leaking information.\n\nFirst, as always, is training. Employees that understand the implications of data breaches, and how to protect themselves can be a better network security system than even the most advanced protection software. This advice remains the same for protecting against intentional data exfiltration too. Employees that understand how seriously their company takes data protection are less likely to run the risk of breaching company policy. Of course, this won't be true in every case, so given a determined insider, what's next?\n\nCompanies need to restrict who's accessing what data. Locking down sensitive information to only those who need to access it greatly reduces the number of potential leaks. Not only does this make incident response easier, but a 50% reduction in how many employees can access sensitive data means halving the number of employees that could leak data in the first place. Tying data access to individual accounts is a must when dealing with data that is considered sensitive, whether it's customer data, company data, or valuable intellectual property held by a business.\n\nThere are also internal systems that can restrict how much data is sent from a network, as well as where data can be sent. Locking down services such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or iCloud Drive can cut off the exfiltration route immediately, the same goes for restricting USB use on client devices. Proper deployment of policy management can reduce exfiltration vectors across the board, making large external data transfers far easier to see when using network monitoring techniques.\n\nWhich brings us onto the last point, using network monitoring systems. Proper visibility of network activity is the key to understanding data flow throughout a network, as well as into and, crucially, out of a protected network. Deploying tools that can carry out this task has the dual benefit of finding the attack phase of data-theft malware, as well as insiders intentionally leaking data. For the more advanced thief, slow leaking of data can also be picked up, often reducing the number of affected customers. Perhaps Sage could have picked up on this activity earlier, and reduced the number of affected customers to double figures, instead of hundreds of them?\n\nLarge numbers of businesses around the world aren't equipped for countering these types of threats, our conversations with the market suggests that most UK businesses have no method of detecting authorised personnel leaking data, with a preference in focusing network security on known malware.",

    "e a defensive tower, and according to expert opinion, was built between 1130 and 1150. Arrowslits, some of which can still be made out, show that the tower had a defensive function in the Middle Ages.\n\nDamscheid was under the lordship of the Electorate of Trier. The village belonged until 1783 to Saint Martin's Collegiate Foundation in Oberwesel, and for a short while also to Saint Stephen's Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Stefan) in Niederburg. About 1785, Damscheid became a parish in its own right.\n\nThe market was first mentioned in the 1767 Oberwesel Council Order. In 1802, the chapel was mentioned. A promotional group around police president Malmen built a new, small chapel in 1975. Since then, a religious service has been held each year in the middle of the forest to commemorate the old pilgrimage church that once stood here, which was consecrated to Saint Aldegonde, after whom the Aldegundesmarkt (market) is also named. The long vanished pilgrimage church was first mentioned in 1477.\n \nIn the Thirty Years' War, Spanish troops pillaged the village, and then came Swedish troops, who did the same thing. Although the village was not burnt down, as the troops had threatened to do, the church was all but destroyed anyway. As early as 1682, however, the church had been built again.\n \nIt was more than one hundred years before the village finally managed to recover from the war's aftermath. In 1759, Damscheid had only 30 hearths (for this, read \u201chouseholds\u201d) and some 200 inhabitants. By 1789, the population had risen to 290. In the course of the 19th century, the number rose to just under 500, a level that remained fairly constant up until 1990, since which time it has risen to 682.\n \nBeginning in 1716, there was a school in Damscheid. In 1798, a completely new school with two classrooms was built. In 1971, the local school was consolidated with school services in Oberwesel. The old school building, however, still serves as a kindergarten.\n \nBeginning in 1794, Damscheid lay under French rule. Under French rule, the municipality was, from 1798, grouped into the Mairie (\u201cMayoralty\u201d) of Wiebelsheim. Later it belonged to the Amt in Oberwesel. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and since 1972, it has been part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Sankt Goar-Oberwesel.\n\nIn 2006, Damscheid celebrated its 750-year jubilee of first documentary mention.\n\nPolitics\n\nMunicipal council\nThe council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nMayor\nDamscheid's mayor is Christian Stahl.\n\nCoat of arms\nThe German blazon reads: In silber vor gr\u00fcn gespaltenem Schilde vorn eine gr\u00fcne Fichte, hinten ein silberner Gitterrost.\n\nThe municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale argent issuant from base a spruce tree vert and vert a gridiron palewise, the handle to base, of the first.\n\nThe charge on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side, the spruce tree, refers to the municipality's great wealth of woodland, while the charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side, the gridiron, is Saint Lawrence's attribute, thus representing the municipality's patron saint.\n\nCulture and sightseeing\n\nBuildings\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:\n Saint John\u2019s Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Johannes), St. Johann-Stra\u00dfe 11a, St. Aldegundis Stra\u00dfe \u2013 Romanesque west tower, about 1150; Late Gothic baptismal chapel built onto the quire, about 1450; Baroque aisleless chapel, 1682; graveyard; Repentance cross, marked 1844; warriors\u2019 memorial, chapellike complex with relief; whole complex of buildings with church and graveyard\n\nSport and leisure\nOwing to its location between the Rhine valley and the Hunsr\u00fcck's wooded heights, Damscheid offers interesting hiking opportunities. From the cultivated landscape of the Rhine valley with its sloped vineyards to the meadows and woods on the village's western edge, there are well signposted hiking trails.\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nDamscheid was once characterized by winegrowing, and indeed, a few winemakers are still to be found, but they are growing fewer. Located in Damscheid are a few small handicraft and industrial-art businesses such as roofers and sanitary fitting firms.\n\nDamscheid is home to many commuters, as the Autobahn A\u00a061 to the west and the Rhine valley to the east are only a few kilometres away.\n\nFamous people\n Friedel Murders (b. 21 May 1953 in Damscheid) is a German record producer and designer of record and CD covers.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  \n\nCategory:Municipalities in Rhineland-Palatinate\nCategory:Rhein-Hunsr\u00fcck-Kreis",

    "to the cause? When does our morbid fascination actually begin to feed the rape culture we say we hate?\n\nThe high-level narrative that most headline-dominating rape cases seem to follow goes like this: An awful sexual assault is committed. Because we all agree that rape is awful, we get together to point out how awful the accused perpetrators are. We pile on the shame. After the dust has settled, though, we\u2019re not left with better services for victims of assault. We\u2019re not left with safe spaces in which young people of all genders can discuss the factors they see as contributing to rape culture. We\u2019re not collectively more supportive of women who come forward to report they were raped by an acquaintance.\n\nWhat we\u2019re usually left with is a lingering notion that rape is primarily (or exclusively) perpetrated by really bad guys, and they are the only ones to blame. Whatever happened at those keggers in Steubenville, it\u2019s pretty clear that this particular assault, and the fallout from it, are not a common situation. In most cases, the accused aren\u2019t caught on video, aren\u2019t exposed by an international group of hackers, and aren\u2019t instantly vilified as really bad guys. Labeling it a \u201che said, she said\u201d situation is a far more common reaction. We can see this play out in statistics about most women\u2019s reluctance to come forward and name their attackers. And sometimes we even see it in the headlines, like the case of Los Angeles cops who \u201cforced sex acts\u201d with drunk women. Rapes are sometimes committed by those we\u2019ve labeled \u201cgood guys.\u201d And pretending that they aren\u2019t doesn\u2019t make it any easier for survivors to report.\n\nIf we\u2019re all bystanders in cases like Steubenville, casually implicated in advancing this narrative, are we also, like Michael Nodianos, somewhat accountable? This seems to be the principle under which Anonymous is operating: We all bear some sort of responsibility for creating a culture of rape, so we\u2019re all on the hook for ending it. But I\u2019m not convinced that all of our righteous anger \u2014 our shaming the perpetrators and bystanders in such a public way \u2014 actually helps dismantle rape culture.\n\nThe question, it seems, is how to turn our gawking into something productive \u2014 and not just for the victim in whatever case is currently making headlines. This infographic (and this helpful corrective to some misleading stats in it) are a good start. They zoom out the lens, make us pay attention to the epidemic rather than one outlier example. The sad truth is that most sexual assaults don\u2019t make for a good SVU narrative arc. They appear far less dramatic, far less clear-cut. And it\u2019s only when we start collectively acknowledging that will justice really be served.",

    "ch the color/contrast/brightness due to their age. In any case, the bezels were buggin\u2019 and so this project was born.\n\nThis is a just a proof of concept, and there are many things I would do differently that I\u2019ll write about later. These are the prototype elevation views I drew up in AutoCAD. The approx. dimensions are 54\u201d x 20\u201d x 20\u201d WxHxD. (The large X\u2019s on the elevation views are the monitor locations.)\n\nTwo monitors are mounted vertical on the right and left side. One monitor is mounted horizontal on the bottom. The half-mirror glass is set at a 45 degree angle in the box between the vertical and horizontal monitors. (The diagonal line in the side view in the middle of the box in the glass.)\n\nSo how does it work? The image from the vertical mounted monitors passes through the half-mirror and the image from the horizontal mounted monitor reflects off the 45 degree angle half-mirror to create the \u2018seamless\u2019, bezel \u2013free, continuous image. (The function is similar to how a teleprompter or stereoscopic display works.)\n\nNext it was time to cut some wood. All of the panels fit on one standard 4x8 sheet of wood, in this case 5/8\u201d particle board. The next step was to cover the panels in black. I used a roll of vinyl laminate from Parts Express. Finally the box started to come together\u2026\n\nI initially tried used some straight rails on the back to hold up the two vertical monitors. This turned out to be a bad idea\u2026 too wobbly. So I switched to L-channel rails.\n\nOnce the wood box was finished and the monitors mounted, it was time to add the half-mirror. Now, I considered several options for this glass. I got a sample piece of two-way mirror from a local glass shop, but it was tinted and it altered the color too much. Then, I went online and checked locally for beam splitter (a.k.a teleprompter) glass, but the cost was waaay too high for this prototype project. Finally, I settled on a piece of clear glass with a semi-silver tint from the local tint shop.\n\nThe next step is to hook up the center monitor to a mirror-flip inverter so the center image appears correctly when reflected on the half-mirror. This was by far the most expensive component of the prototype.\n\nOnce the glass was mounted, then came aligning the monitors. Now ideally, the display areas of the vertical and horizontal monitors would be *exactly* the same distance from the half-mirror glass. Also, the glass would be mounted at a *perfect* 45 degree angle. Then, the two vertical mounted monitors would slide left & right and the horizontal mounted monitor would slide back and forth until the display areas lined up perfectly. Once this happens, you can move from side to side of the box and the bezels are gone!\n\nWell, this being a prototype, the glass wasn\u2019t quite a perfect 45 degrees and it was extremely difficult to manually get the monitors to be the same distance from the glass. This was an inherent design flaw in this prototype- the vertical mounted monitors only moved left to right but also needed to move front to back. (The verticals ended up a slightly different distance from the glass as the horizontal monitor). But\u2026 I was still able to get a pretty damn good alignment that looks really good if you are sitting in the center of the display.\n\nNote that I still haven\u2019t gotten the brightness/contrast adjusted to be the same on all of the monitors, but the color is very close. Also, the last pic above looks like there are lines between the monitors when viewed from the side. This is due to the vertical monitors being slightly further away from the half-mirror.\n\nHere are a couple short videos of the display in action. Apologies for the grainy video, but you get the idea. Setup is three 20\u201d HP monitors, 4800x1200, and of course no bezel compensation.\n\nMy favorite wide screen indie game, Syder Arcade.\n\nNeed for Speed HP\n\nNinja Warriors Arcade (An 80\u2019s three monitor arcade game that used this exact setup)\n\nClosing thoughts:The brightness/contrast would be much easier to match across the monitors if I was using true beam splitter glass that reflects/transmits 50%. The tint I\u2019m using reflects/transmits ~35%, so it is not ideal. However, beam splitter glass of this size would have cost $900+ where my piece of silver tinted glass was <$100.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I can ever get these particular monitors to match color/contrast exactly since they are old and at least one is pretty dim. But the ability to adjust the RGB on each monitor got me pretty close on the colors.\n\nThere should a better way to mirror-flip the center monitor image instead of using the expensive hardware based solution I have here. Modified driver? Modified firmware? If only I had the time to tinker more\u2026.\n\nOne downside of using a setup like this is that monitor brightness is reduced as the image passes through and/or reflects off the half-mirror. This is a trade-off for a zero-bezel display setup\u2026.\n\nI\u2019ll probably try and build a version 2.0 of this mirror setup sometime in the spring or summer. The design will need to be improved for monitor alignment and to get a perfect glass angle. Who knows, maybe I can even score a cheap piece of beam splitter glass. Once version 2.0 is done, it\u2019s going into a custom arcade/gaming cabinet!\n\nCheck out the arcade version of Darius Burst that uses two 32\u201d LCDs for an ultra-wide gaming experience. This is a good example of modern bezel-free multi-monitor gaming at its best. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpEz3dsbwUc\n\nNot sure what hardware you're using but something like Eyefinity or NVIDIA's Surround may have the option to flip hor/vert each monitor. I know this is not possible with Matrox Triplehead2go, maybe someone else can chime in on this.\n\nI think a proxy directx dll could do the flipping/mirroring for you, basically youd just need to flip the direct3d backbuffer in the middle section before presenting. You could look at the source for SoftTH here http://www.kegetys.fi/forum/index.php?topic=3176.0 for a bit of guidance.\n\nThe bad about this is some games may think you are cheating and directx9 is the only option.\n\nHaving been an arcade kid of the 80's, I totally forgot about some of those ultra-wide screen games One thing you could possibly consider to increase brightness is to remove any AG coating the screens may have.Since they are in an enclosure and you are viewing them from the reflected angles and not directly, an AG coating may not be needed.\n\nWow this is incredible! I really want to try it with my displays. I just purchased 3x27\" IPS 120Hz monitors.\n\nBeam-splitting glass is so expensive. Is there a way to possibly use glass reflective film to reproduce the two-way mirror like affect for much cheaper? I was looking at a website that was doing a DIY for a teleprompter and it uses beam-splitter glass as well to do this. The website used a slate window film that has 50% reflective to accomplish this. Here is the website:http://tompter.com/index-5.html\n\nIt appears to do a great job and can just be laid over a standard piece of glass or even acrylic. I have e-mails out to the company that makes the film to see how much it would be for a piece to span over 3 27\" monitors. The film reflects on one side and allows the image to pass through the other side much like beam-splitter glass. Let me know what you think of this idea.\n\nAnother thing I was pondering...was if there is a way to have the side monitors (left and right) be angled at 45 degree angle like most people set it up while being able to still use the mirror technique for a zero-bezel display.\n\nAlso I was thinking of expanding this idea...would there be a way to do a 4-head configuration in a square (2 top and 2 right below it) with this technique? That would make a huge combined display with amazing resolution and would be awesome for more applications such as movies and everything.\n\nI will continue to post anything I find on the film and progress I have.\n\nAllGamer wrote:wouldn't I'd be better if all 3 monitors were mirrored, then you wont have the trouble of matching colour & brightness as all 3 of them will be going through the same \"filter\"\n\nHow would you be able to mirror all 3 while still keeping the zero bezel. I think they have to overlap the bezels in order to achieve this and it wouldnt be possible if they were all next to eachother...not sure maybe if we could expand on the idea.\n\n@Racer_SI'm using an Eyefinity setup (single HD5770), but there are no options to mirror-flip a single screen. I did some research on the web and it might be possible to do this using an ATI FirePro card since they have more features in the drivers. But they are pretty expensive and I couldn't acquire a FirePro card for testing. I think NVIDIA dropped their stereoscopic driver support and that would have provided the same mirror-flip capability.\n\nIf anyone finds a better way to mirror-flip a single screen in a multi-monitor Eyefinity setup, I'm all ears. I'm thinking it would have to be a custom driver or firmware.\n\n@ AllGamerI'm not sure how it would be possible to mirror all three monitors due to the way the bezels overlap in the reflection. There is probably a way using even fancier optics and reflections, but it is beyond my skill.\n\n@BrokenBlade30I am just using regular glass with a silver mirror tint, though all I could find was a 35% film. I'll probably special order a 50% silver mirror tint and see if it improves the brightness/contrast in the next iteration of this project. One thing to keep in mind with normal mirror tints is that they are meant to go on the inside of a window, so you get a reflection when looking through the glass. However, in this setup, the tint needs to be on the outside of the glass (closest to the reflecting monitor) or else you will get a blur in the reflection as the image bounces between the film and the glass. Apparently there are special mirror tints that reflect on the outside vs. the inside, but they would be special order. There is also acrylic beam splitter, but it is still much more expensive than plain glass with a silver tint and plexi-glass scratches easily.\n\nOne thing I recommend is to build a simple cardboard prototype using a 6\" piece of sample glass and some free tint samples from your local tint shop. I used a couple cell phones as screens in my cardboard prototype to test the different types of glass, tints, etc. before ordering & building. This is how I found out that the tint needs to be 'reversed' and closest to the reflecting monitor.\n\nOK, you guys might consider this cheating... but since we are going through the trouble of putting the monitors in a BOXit wouldn't hurt to go the extra mile and remove the casing from the monitors (bezels)\n\ndepending on the LCD/LED panel quality you might have almost no border at allyou can still overlap one monitor on top of the other to get an even thinner black border\n\nto completely remote that line, will require some cheat cheat on the reflective surface as well.\n\ninstead of one continuous mirror, you'd want 3 pieces of it, so you'd bend the mirrors right at the edge of the black border\n\nthat should setup a proper nVidia 2D Surround View for games and such, and still give you the feel of the 180 wrapped around, instead of the fish eye effect\n\nThat's just theory, it'll still need to be tested in real life to see how well it hides, or rather it fails to reflect the black border.\n\nWho is online\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe FOV Calc & Source Engine HUD Editor, as well as being able to edit the HUD on source games, also contains a good FOV and Aspect Ratio calculator.

    " experiences or specialized knowledge on actual damages and repairs performed over a period of time. However, the current repair processes may not utilize the specialized knowledge stored in the database in providing the repair solutions for the damages. Further, the commercial aircraft industry nowadays uses composite materials for various structural components. The damage and repair of the structural components made of composite materials can be more complex than the repair of components made of metallic structures. Furthermore, the composite repair technology is in its initial stages and is still evolving. Thus, the SRMs may not contain an exhaustive list of damage and repair scenarios related to the structural components made of composite materials. Therefore, the repair of composite materials poses several challenges for the airliners, depots, and OEMs. Furthermore, updated versions of the SRMs are released by the OEMs periodically over the lifetime of the aircraft. The updated versions include a new set of guidelines for damage identification and repair instructions that need to be studied again and adapted in practice to identify the repair solutions.\nIn light of the discussion above, there is a need for a solution for supporting the repair processes to provide fast, effective, reliable, and consistent repair solutions for metallic as well as composite structures. Further, the solution should use the SRMs as well as the previous damage and repair information to provide the repair solutions. Furthermore, the solution should support the different aircraft configurations available in the industry and the various versions of the SRMs.",
    "anodically oxidized Al, Al claded by molybdenum (Mo) alloy, or double layered aluminum (Al) is used. In the case of aluminum-neodymium (Al\u2014Nd) alloy the resistivity of interconnections is about 5.1 \u03bc\u03a9cm, while the resistivity of pure aluminum (Al) is 2.5 \u03bc\u03a9cm.\nTherefore, interconnections composed of three layers of titanium/aluminum/titanium (Ti/Al/Ti) or molybdenum/aluminum/molybdenum (Mo/Al/Mo) are used as a countermeasure against the above mentioned problems of hillocks, migrations, etc. when pure aluminum (Al) is practically used as a material for interconnections. However, this multilayer structure brings about new problems such as an increase in the layer formation process.\nOn the other hand, nowadays, copper (Cu) is considered to be an attractive material for thin film transistor (TFT) electrodes or interconnections because it represents a low electrical resistance compared to the other materials used in TFT electrodes or interconnections. However, copper (Cu) has poor characteristics with regards to the adhesiveness with insulating layers, in particular, with glass, which is a material used for the substrate of TFT. In addition, copper (Cu) gets easily oxidized when formed on an insulating layer.\nAccordingly, to resolve the above-mentioned problems, a technique employing alloyed copper interconnections is attempted in TFT-LCD devices. This technique aims at securing the adhesiveness to the glass substrate by reaction of alloy elements with the substrate forming a layer at their interface. In addition, this technique also aims at forming an oxide layer on a surface of copper (Cu), in which the alloy elements function as an oxidation-resistance layer with a low resistivity for the copper (Cu).\nHowever, according to the proposed technique, characteristics that are aimed at are not sufficiently achieved. Electric resistance of copper (Cu) increases due to the fact that alloy elements are remaining in Cu layer, and therefore it could not show its advantage over conventional interconnection materials such as aluminum (Al) or aluminum alloy.\nFurther, as shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-163901, in order to utilize a copper interconnection in TFT-LCD devices, another technique is proposed in that a molybdenum (Mo) alloy layer is interposed between the copper (Cu) layer and the substrate, thereby securing the adhesiveness and the barrier properties with the substrate.\nHowever, according to this technique, the manufacturing process has an additional step for depositing molybdenum (Mo) alloy. In addition, the effective resistance of interconnections increases in this structure. Further, although a single layer of copper (Cu) is utilized for the source and drain electrodes of TFT-LCD devices, their stability remains under question.\nFurther, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-139057, in order to resolve the above mentioned problems with regards to the copper (Cu) interconnections, another technique is proposed in that a high-melting-point nitride such as tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN) or tungsten nitride (WN) is formed around the copper (Cu). However, this technique arises other problems such as, for example, a new material for forming the barrier layer and even an additional process are required compared to the case where conventional materials are used for the interconnections. In addition, the effective resistance of the interconnection increases because a high-resistivity barrier layer is deposited thickly around the copper (Cu).\nFurther, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-166757 discloses that an addition of one or more elements of magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti) and chromium (Cr) to the copper (Cu) of the interconnections in TFT-LCD devices improves the adhesiveness as well as the oxidation resistance. However, another problem arises in that the interconnection resistance increases as the additional elements are remaining in the interconnections. In addition, the interconnection resistance increases because the additional elements reduce oxides in the substrate layer and the reduced elements diffuse into the interconnection.\nJapanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-69550 discloses another technique, which tries to improve the oxidation resistance by adding silver (Ag) of 0.3 to 10 weight percent to the copper (Cu). However, in this case, the adhesiveness to the glass substrate is not improved, and sufficient oxidation resistance may not be acquired to withstand liquid crystal manufacturing process.\nJapanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-158887 proposes a copper alloy in which at least one element of titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), aluminum (Al) and silver (Ag) is added by 0.5 to weight percent to the copper (Cu). However, the additional element increases electric resistance of the interconnections.\nJapanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-91907 discloses the addition of molybdenum (Mo) by 0.1 to 3.0 weight percent to the copper (Cu) and segregation of molybdenum (Mo) to a grain boundary suppresses oxidation by grain boundary diffusion. Although this technique can improve oxidation resistance of the copper (Cu), there is a problem in that the interconnection resistance increases.\nInternational Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. WO2006-025347 discloses that an oxide protective layer formed by an additional element will suppress the oxidation of Cu in the copper alloy layer in which the appropriate additional element is added. The protective layer is formed at an interface of an adjacent insulating layer that suppresses the mutual diffusion. This technique provides a copper interconnection that has high conductivity and good adhesiveness with the substrate. Further, this technique provides liquid crystal display (LCD) devices utilizing this copper interconnections. In addition, this publication suggests that manganese (Mn) is preferable as one of the additional elements. However, this technique is insufficient to realize features of interconnection structures used in the liquid crystal display (LCD) devices and TFT electrode structures.\nJapanese patent No. 3302894 proposes a TFT structure used in TFT-LCD devices and explicitly discloses the gate electrode of TFT structure is covered by an oxide layer when a Cu alloy is applied to the gate electrode. This patent discloses that when a first metal is Cu, a second metal is at least one element selected from titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta), niobium (Nb), silicon (Si), boron (B), lanthanum (La), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), dysprosium (Dy), yttrium (Y), ytterbium (Yb), cerium (Ce), magnesium (Mg), thorium (Th), and chromium (Cr). However, the second element is different from an additional element of the present invention.\nNone of the above-mentioned documents refers to a structure of source or drain electrodes in a TFT structure. However, high adhesiveness to a semiconductor layer or a pixel electrode, tolerability to a circumstance in which the TFT electrode is used, and stability of electric contacts with source or drain electrodes portion are required for the structure of the source or drain electrode. Therefore, the structure of the source or drain electrode is an important element of liquid crystal display (LCD) device.\nAs mentioned above, according to these conventional techniques, although adhesiveness to the semiconductor layer or the pixel electrode and the oxidation-resistance layer are tried to be secured by adding an additional alloyed element to the copper (Cu), a sufficient result is not yet obtained in all techniques. Further, sufficient results are not obtained with regard to the high adhesiveness to the semiconductor layer or the pixel electrode and tolerability of circumstances in which the TFT electrode is used. In the same way, the requirement of having stable electric contacts with the source or drain electrodes portion are not yet met.\nEspecially, although the International Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. WO2006-025347 suggests the liquid crystal display (LCD) device using copper interconnections, a sufficient structure for realizing the gate interconnection structure utilized in the liquid crystal display (LCD) device is not yet achieved by the suggested technique. Further, the Japanese patent No. 3302894 clearly specifies that an oxide layer covering a gate electrode is an oxide layer mainly composed of a second metal element, which is formed by applying a heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere. However, it is not described at all nor even suggested that the adhesiveness between the semiconductor layer and the source electrode or drain electrode is secured by forming an oxide layer on the source or drain electrodes as a result of reaction between Cu alloy and a Si oxide layer contacting to the Cu alloy by heat treatment, as mentioned in the present invention. Further, an electrically stable contact between the source electrode or drain electrode and the semiconductor layer is not described nor suggested.\nIn other words, there is a need to provide a solution for all the above-mentioned problems such as, for example, depositing the Cu alloy layer with fewer process steps, decreasing effective resistance of interconnections, and forming a stable electric contact with improving the adhesiveness between the semiconductor layer and the source or drain electrodes. However, these problems cannot be solved by the above-mentioned conventional techniques, therefore actual products, featuring all the requirements, are difficult to be manufactured.\nThe present invention is made under the above-mentioned situation. The purpose of the present invention is to prevent an oxidation of interconnection materials, including a source electrode or drain electrode, by forming an oxide layer covering the interconnections and securing a high adhesiveness to a semiconductor layer or a pixel electrode. Further, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal display (LCD) device having a TFT structure in which a source electrode or drain electrode is sandwiched between the semiconductor layer, such as amorphous silicon, and a passivation layer with a stable ohmic contact.",

    " is difficult for me to conceive, and to admit, that Cittamatrin refute external existence altogether. It would mean they refute that one is born from a mother and a father, and so forth. Moreover, I doubt Tibetan scholars who claim that 'Cittamatrin refute external existence' because they have an agenda. Tibetan scholars often simplify (if not even caricature) their opponent's positions (in this case, Cittamatrin). So, not sticking to Tibetan literature only, my idea was to seek whether Cittamatrin actually refute external existence by reading works written by proponents of the Cittamatra school. Let us consider Suzuki, in Studies in the Lankavatara (p. 114). He writes:\n\nAs indeed the idealistic Mahayana does not admit the\n  existence of an external world, whatever qualities we ordinarily think\n  as belonging to the latter are creations or constructions of our own\n  mind.\n\nSuzuki seems to say \"Cittamatra refute external existence\", but he does not do so explicitly. He says \"they do not admit the existence of an external world\" but this does not necessarily amount to \"refuting the existence of external world\". As far as I know, he could be saying \"We can not know anything but the aspects our consciousness takes. We can not see beyond our perceptions. We can not know for sure whether our perceptions are perceptions of something external. So, let us not bother with thinking of an external world - be it to refute its existence or claim its existence - and let us stick with what we know: that the eye-consciousness seeing blue takes the aspect of blue, and that we know nothing else.\"\n\nThus, the question is: Do Cittamatra / Yogacara explicitly refute the existence of an external world? Or do they simply \"not admit, not take into acount\" the existence of an external world?\nReferences are welcome.\n\nA:\n\nAccording to Kagyu understanding, Yogacara's position isn't metaphysical, it is methodological. It's not that the external world does not exist, it is that our experience of the world is 100% always represented by organs and/or mind, there is no experience outside of that, so practically speaking mind-made experience is \"all we have\"*\nWhich is why trying to figure out how exactly the experience is generated and mastering the practical skills for working with mind and experience is of key importance in Yogacara (comparing to the earlier Buddhism's focus on discipline/ethics and the Madhyamika's focus on philosophy).\n\nYogacarins put so much emphasis on the mind because they are concerned with\n  practice. Some people have thought they were saying that everything is in your\n  mind. Some of these people were influenced by certain Western philosophies.   -- Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche \n\nGenerally speaking Kaguypas seem to prefer to stay away from philosophical discussions and focus on practice, which makes sense given their self-identification as \"the practice lineage\":\n\nWe are not concerned about whether or not a chair exists. That's\n  secondary. Why spend so much time arguing about whether or not a chair exists,\n  instead of learning how we experience and relate to the chair, and what sort of\n  experience we've got? -- Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche\n\n*Using the modern language we could say, reality is an interpretation we make, there is no reality to be experienced outside of an interpretation. In other words, there is no absolute truth separate from the conventional truth.\n\nA:\n\nDownplaying the external world (is \"external world\" quite the same as 'form (r\u016bpa)'?), saying that our ideas of it are reified fabrications of the mind created from (or dependent on) sense-contact, seems to me a feature even of the Pali suttas ... with the proviso that nihilism (e.g. \"There is nothing given, nothing offered, etc.\"), and presumably solipsism, are identified as a \"wrong view\".\nDistinguishing or reconciling these views is I think known as the 'two truths' doctrine[s].\nThe following answer is not expert; it's slightly referenced but just recently researched because of your question.\n\nThe Theory of Two Truths in India seems to me to support the thesis (that Yogacara explicitly refute the existence of an external world).\nSome quotes from this article are:\n\nThe central thesis in the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy, the theory of the two truths echoes this, is the assertion that all that is conventionally real is only ideas, representations, images, creations of the mind, and that there is no conventionally real object that exists outside the mind to which it corresponds. These ideas are the only objects of any cognition. The whole universe is a mental universe.\nApart from those representations, consciousnesses, which appear to be external objects, there is no conventionally real external content which corresponds to what appears.\nAll these arguments based on the facts of experience show that the objects do not exist really outside the mind, that they are the products of mental creation and that their appearance is entirely mind dependent. Therefore Yog\u0101c\u0101ra's theory of the two truths concludes that the whole world is a product of mind\u2014it is the collective mental action (karma) of all beings. All living beings see the same world because of the identical maturation of their karmic consequences. Since the karmic histories of beings are same, there is homogeneity in the way in which the world is experienced and perceived. This is the reason there is an orderly world instead of chaotic and arbitrariness. This is also the reason behind the impressions of the objectivity of the world.\n\nI expect you'll want to investigate the author's claims in more detail (using the references which he cites).\n\nConversely Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Critiques of the Two Truths seems to me to present a different picture, in which the Yogacara aren't so external-world-doesn't-exist extreme:\n\nThese remarks of Vasubandhu\u2019s are probably the very first attempt on\nthe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra side to incorporate the two truths into their more complicated\nstructure of the three natures. Based on these remarks, we can\ndraw the following diagram:\n                      emptiness of persons & dharmas \u2014existent(?)\nultimate truth \u2014\n                      no persons or dharmas \u2014nonexistent(?)\n\n                      dependent nature \u2014existent(?)\nconventional truth \u2014\n                      imagined nature \u2014nonexistent(?)\n\nAs we see, the conventional truth is described as having two aspects.\nViewed as the imagined nature (parikalpita-svabh\u0101va), it does not exist;\nwhile viewed as the dependent nature (paratantra-svabh\u0101va), it does exist.\nSo conventional reality cannot be one-sidedly taken as purely imaginary\nor illusory; this would be to fall into nihilism. Nor can conventional reality\nbe taken as utterly existent, on the other hand, because the imagined\nnature does not exist. That is why the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra criticizes both of the extremes\ninto which his Madhyamaka opponent tends to fall.\n\nAccording to this paper, the Yogacara doctrine isn't just that the conventional (external?) world is imaginary: it has a merely-imaginary (unreal) component but also a dependent (existent albeit empty) component.\nAnd allegedly the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra criticizes and accuses their \"Madhyamaka opponents\" of nihilism and extremism, which implies that they hold their own doctrine to be innocent of such extremism.\nIn conclusion:\n\nOne of the goals of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra theory of the three natures was to\nimprove on this two-tiered paradigm, and to restore a more robust and\nholistic worldview. My study of some scattered sources from Maitreyan\u0101tha,\nAsa\u1e45ga, and Vasubandhu has demonstrated that they criticized\nthe Madhyamaka version of two truths doctrine on the basis of the Yog\u0101-\nc\u0101ra theory of the three natures.\n\nSo the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra develop the doctrine of The Three Natures, one of which is the world as it's understood according to the theory of dependent origination.\n\n",
    "mple, a half-wavelength dipole antenna or the like. The antenna 11 transmits and receives radio waves of an operational frequency (communication carrier frequency) fo. A VHF (Very High Frequency) band or a UHF (Ultra High Frequency) band is generally allocated for the communication carrier frequency fo.\nThe interdigital electrode 12 has an electrode pitch d1 (=\u03bb0/2) of half a wavelength \u03bb0 of a surface acoustic wave. The interdigital electrode 12 excites the surface acoustic wave via a piezoelectric effect by a radio wave (high-frequency electric field) received by the antenna 11. That is, the interdigital electrode 12 supplies the radio wave received by the antenna 11 as the surface acoustic wave to the reflection electrodes 13 to 15.\nThe reflection electrodes 13 to 15 reflect the surface acoustic wave supplied from the interdigital electrode 12. That is, it can also be said that the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 emit a reflected wave in response to the surface acoustic wave. The reflected wave emitted from one of the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 is transmitted as a radio wave from the antenna 11 via the interdigital electrode 12.\nThe SAW tag 1 has unique data for identifying the SAW tag 1 itself. A reflection electrode (the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 in the example of FIG. 1) indicates that a predetermined piece of bit data including the unique data is \u201c1.\u201d Specifically, in the conventional SAW tag 1, a position representing each bit of the unique data is predetermined; when a reflection electrode is placed at a position corresponding to a predetermined bit, bit data of the bit is \u201c1,\u201d while when no reflection electrode is placed at the position, the bit data of the bit is \u201c0.\u201d\nThus, the unique data in FIG. 1 is 4 bits. The reflection electrode 13 is placed at a position representing the most significant bit (first bit); the reflection electrode 14 is placed at a position representing the next bit (second bit); the reflection electrode 15 is placed at a position representing the least significant bit (fourth bit in the example of FIG. 1); and no reflection electrode is placed at a position representing the third bit. Hence, the unique data is 4 bits of \u201c1101.\u201d In other words, FIG. 1 shows an example of the configuration of the SAW tag 1 when 4-bit data of \u201c1101\u201d is assigned as the unique data. That is, since the unique data of the SAW tag 1 differs for each apparatus type, the number of reflection electrodes and placement positions differ for each apparatus type.\nThe operation of a tag reader (not shown in the figure) recognizing the SAW tag 1 will next be described with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.\nFIG. 2 is a timing chart showing the timing of transmission of check pulses and the timing of reception of reflected pulses in response to the check pulses in the tag reader.\nIncidentally, in this case, a transmission pulse transmitted from the tag reader to check (detect) the unique data of the SAW tag (the SAW tag 1 of FIG. 1 in this case) is referred to as a check pulse. A pulse corresponding to a reflected wave occurring when a surface acoustic wave corresponding to a check pulse is reflected from a reflection electrode (the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 in the example of FIG. 1) is referred to as a reflected pulse.\nFIG. 3 is a diagram showing the relationship between a surface acoustic wave corresponding to a check pulse and reflected waves in response to the surface acoustic wave (reflected waves corresponding to reflected pulses).\nSuppose that, as shown in FIG. 2, for example, the tag reader transmits a check pulse 21 at a time t0.\nThe check pulse 21 transmitted from the tag reader passes through the antenna 11 and the interdigital electrode 12 in FIG. 1, and then arrives at each of the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 as a surface acoustic wave 41, as shown in FIG. 3. The arrived surface acoustic wave 41 is reflected by the reflection electrodes 13 to 15, and returned to the interdigital electrode 12 as reflected waves 51 to 53, respectively. That is, the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 emit the reflected waves 51 to 53, respectively.\nThe reflected waves 51 to 53 are each transmitted as a radio wave via the interdigital electrode 12 and the antenna 11. The tag reader receives the radio waves, and then detects the radio waves as a reflected pulse 31, a reflected pulse 32, and a reflected pulse 34, respectively, as shown in FIG. 2.\nHowever, as shown in FIG. 3 (FIG. 1), since the placement positions of the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 differ from each other, the arrival times of the reflected waves 51 to 53 at the tag reader differ from each other.\nSpecifically, as shown in FIG. 2, the tag reader detects the reflected pulse 31 corresponding to the reflected wave 51 emitted by the reflection electrode 13 at a time t1 after the passage of a time T1 from a time to at which the check pulse 21 is transmitted. Thereby, the tag reader determines that the bit data of the first bit (most significant bit) in the unique data of the SAW tag 1 to which the check pulse 21 is transmitted is \u201c1.\u201d\nSimilarly, the tag reader detects the reflected pulse 32 corresponding to the reflected wave 52 emitted by the reflection electrode 14 at a time t2 after the passage of a time T2 from the time t0 at which the check pulse 21 is transmitted. Thereby, the tag reader determines that the bit data of the second bit in the unique data of the SAW tag 1 to which the check pulse 21 is transmitted is \u201c1.\u201d\nOn the other hand, a reflected pulse 33 does not arrive at the tag reader even at a time t3 at which the reflected pulse 33 next to the reflected pulse 32 is to arrive (the SAW tag 1 in FIG. 1 has no reflection electrode disposed to emit a reflected wave corresponding to the reflected pulse 33). Thereby, the tag reader determines that the bit data of the third bit in the unique data of the SAW tag 1 to which the check pulse 21 is transmitted is \u201c0.\u201d\nThen, the tag reader detects the reflected pulse 34 corresponding to the reflected wave 53 emitted by the reflection electrode 15 at a time t4 after the passage of a time T3 from the time to at which the check pulse 21 is transmitted. Thereby, the tag reader determines that the bit data of the fourth bit (least significant bit) in the unique data of the SAW tag 1 to which the check pulse 21 is transmitted is \u201c1.\u201d\nThus, the tag reader can detect that the unique data of the SAW tag 1 to which the check pulse 21 is transmitted is \u201c1101\u201d and thereby recognizes the SAW tag 1.\nA SAW tag 61 as shown in FIG. 4 is disclosed in L. Reindl and W. Ruile, Programmable Reflectors for SAW-ID-Tags, Siemens AG, Corporate Research and Development, Munich, Germany, 1993, Ultrasonic Symposium, pp. 125\u2013130. As shown in FIG. 4, the SAW tag 61 has an antenna 11 and an interdigital electrode 12 having basically the same configuration and function as the SAW tag 1 of FIG. 1. However, the SAW tag 61 of FIG. 4 has reflection electrodes 71 to 74, which are interdigital electrodes having an electrode pitch d2 (=\u03bb0/4) of \u00bc of a wavelength \u03bb0 of a surface acoustic wave, in place of the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 of the SAW tag 1 of FIG. 1.\nEach of the reflection electrodes 71 to 74 functions as a reflector to reflect a surface acoustic wave when both terminals thereof are open. On the other hand, each of the reflection electrodes 71 to 74 does not function as a reflector and passes a surface acoustic wave when both terminals thereof are short-circuited. Thus, by changing a state of connection of both terminals of each of the reflection electrodes 71 to 74, it is possible to control the reflection and passage of a surface acoustic wave.\nIn FIG. 4, for correspondence with FIG. 1, each of the reflection electrode 71, the reflection electrode 72, and the reflection electrode 74 has both terminals thereof open to function as a reflector. That is, each of the reflection electrode 71, the reflection electrode 72, and the reflection electrode 74 reflects a surface acoustic wave supplied from the interdigital electrode 12, as with the reflection electrodes 13 to 15 in FIG. 1. In other words, each of the reflection electrode 71, the reflection electrode 72, and the reflection electrode 74 emits a reflected wave in response to the surface acoustic wave, and supplies the reflected wave to the interdigital electrode 12.\nSince both terminals of the reflection electrode 73 are short-circuited, the reflection electrode 73 passes the surface acoustic wave supplied from the interdigital electrode 12. That is, the reflection electrode 73 does not emit a reflected wave in response to the surface acoustic wave (does not supply a reflected wave to the interdigital electrode 12).\nThus, the SAW tag 61 having the configuration of FIG. 4 operates in exactly the same manner as the SAW tag 1 having the configuration of FIG. 1. By performing basically the same processes as the series of processes described above, the tag reader can detect that the unique data of the SAW tag 61 having the configuration of FIG. 4 is also \u201c1101,\u201d and recognizes the SAW tag 61.\nHowever, a reflection electrode in conventional SAW tags having the configurations of FIG. 1 and FIG. 4 functions to represent one predetermined piece of bit data included in the unique data. Therefore, as the number of bits of the unique data is increased, the number of reflection electrodes needs to be correspondingly increased by the same number. As a result, as the number of bits of the unique data is increased, the physical size of the SAW tag becomes larger.\nIn the example of FIG. 2, although the amplitude of the reflected pulses is shown as being the same as the amplitude of the check pulse (transmission pulse from the tag reader) for simplicity of description, in practice, the more distant the position of the reflection electrodes is from the interdigital electrode (interdigital electrode 12 in FIG. 1 and FIG. 4), the more the amplitude of the reflected pulses will be attenuated. That is, the amplitude of the reflected pulse corresponding to the surface acoustic wave reflected (that is, the reflected wave emitted) by the reflection electrode disposed at the position corresponding to the least significant bit of the unique data (for example, the reflection electrode 15 in the example of FIG. 1 and the reflection electrode 74 in the example of FIG. 4) will be attenuated greatly. As a result, the larger the number of bits in the unique data of the SAW tag (that is, the more distant the reflection electrode is from the interdigital electrode), the more difficult it is for the tag reader to recognize the SAW tag (to detect bit data of the least significant bit of the unique data).",

    "fruits and vegetables with high water content. However, the home remedies for prickly heat are more effective and without any side effects. Here are some home remedies for prickly heat that will give you relief from your heat rashes.\n\nHome Remedies for Prickly Heat\n\n1.Oatmeal bath is one of the very effective home remedies for prickly heat. Add some oatmeal powder in to your bath water.\n\n2.The common treatment for prickly heat is to apply non-perfumed talcum powder or the specially made prickly heat powder for four to five times a day.\n\n3. Take some neem (margosa) leaves and make a paste by grinding with water. Apply this on sweat rashes. Neem has antibacterial properties and can heal the infectious blisters of advanced rash.\n\n4. Apply aloe Vera gel on prickly heat to get relief from itching as well as to heal them. It contains excellent healing properties and will provide a cooling effect\n\n5. Prepare a cooling compress for your itchy and dreadful prickly heat. Dilute 1 tsp of baking soda into 1 cup of cold water. Soak a clean washcloth into the solution and squeeze it out to remove excess water. Apply the cloth to the rashes. While the water will reduce inflammation, the baking soda will work towards easing itching and irritation. Repeat 4 to 5 times a day for best results.\n\n6.Prepare a smooth paste by mixing cornstarch or flour with water. Smudge the paste over the affected areas and allow it to dry for about \u00bd hour. Thereafter, go for a cold water bath and wash off the paste.\n\n7. Rub an ice cube on heat rashes to get quick relief from the burning sensation. You can also use cold compress or ice pack.\n\n8.Take two tablespoons each of coriander powder and sandalwood powder. Add enough rose water to make a thick paste out of it. Apply the paste on your prickly heat rashes and let it dry. When dry, wash it off with cold water.\n\n10. Gooseberry: Take an earthen vessel and fill with water, then put some gooseberries cut in pieces in the pot and cover it. Leave as it is for the whole night. On the next day, mash up the berries in the pot, then filter the water, add sugar or honey and drink. It removes heat from the body and helps for digestive system.\n\n11. Take henna powder and make a thick paste with cold water. Apply this to cool off the pricking heat rashes. However, this might leave the area reddened due to the coloring effect of henna. You can apply this home remedy for the prickly heat rashes that would get covered with clothing.\n\n12.Prickly heat needs to be cured internally too. That is why I advise you to drink lime juice at least three glasses per day. .\n\n13.Take about five tablespoons of Fuller\u2019s earth and add rosewater to make a paste. Apply this paste on prickly heat. Wash with cold water when it dries off.\n\n14. Banyan tree barks also help in treating prickly heat effectively. Take dry barks of the banyan tree and grind them into a fine powder. Apply this powder on affected areas for quick relief from prickly heat.\n\n15.Apply watermelon pulp on the prickly heat to heal them.\n\n16. Crush some leaves of Indian plum (jamun) and add baking soda to it. Apply this to your prickly heat for instant relief.\n\n17. Take some neem oil and add camphor extract to this. Massage the body parts with sweat rashes with this oil. Let it be there for about half an hour. Take bath with cool water.\n\n18.Mix gramflour with water to make a diluted paste. Apply this to your body where you have prickly heat. Let it dry for about an hour. Have shower with cool water.\n\n19. Put one camphor tablet in a small bottle of coconut oil. Leave it overnight for the camphor to melt in the oil. Apply this oil n regular intervals on the rashes. This heals the rashes quick.\n\n20.Honey is a great source for speeding up the healing process. Apply it over effected area.\n\n21. Cucumbers are another source of water for body and coolness. Directly apply to affected skin, or eat it.\n\nEthnic Health Court is all about Health.\nEthnic Health Court tries to convey health related issues, its solutions, and quality life style in a simple and effective way.\n\nThe focus here is on the content with supporting images or graphics.

    "erforming Arts was crowded with young people, even very young people, who chose to spend Friday with one of Israel\u2019s best dance troupes. The performance, pleasing enough in and of itself, was particularly heartwarming under the circumstances. You\u2019d think that, at a time like this, with battles raging, culture would fade away; well, here it was, holding its head high.\n\nThe flowering of dance in Israel is something special.Alongside troupes like the Batsheva Dance Company and the Kibbutz Dance Company, dozens of choreographers and hundreds of dancers are developing. Once a year, at the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater, when they feature their best productions, they achieve international exposure.\n\nThat sense of unease began with the sound of the wind, blowing across a vast, deserted space. As the twilight glow came up on Inbal Pinto and Avshalom Pollak\u2019s \u201cOyster,\u201d a little shiver went down my spine.\n\nOutside of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, crowds of people were lolling in the green lawn, enjoying the warm sunny afternoon, but the less fortunate they, because those of us who had wandered into Pinto\u2019s dark cavern of circus freaks were in for a wild ride.\n\nPinto, who is a former member of Israel\u2019s acclaimed Batsheva Company, incorporates many familiar theatrical touches into her sideshow \u2013 the white-face makeup, zany costumes, a bare stage framed by naked light bulbs that suggest a dilapidated carnival \u2013 but the pleasure of \u201cOyster\u201d is not that it breaks new ground, but in how expertly she and collaborator Pollak have put the elements together.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen duets with aerial work before, but rarely done with such ease and insouciance. Dancers have been strung and manipulated like puppets before, but rarely with such creepy implications. But \u201cOyster\u2019s\u201d cavalcade of sideshow freaks displays a canny understanding of the real art of pantomime, and though it has been categorized by presenter San Francisco Performances as \u201cdance,\u201d it\u2019s really a skillful theater piece.\n\nThe twelve members of the troupe take on personas that defy adequate description, ranging from circus animals \u2013 performing dogs, elephants, etc. \u2013 to a double headed barker, whom I found to be as disturbing as \u201cLaughing Sal,\u201d the coin-operated doll that used to stand in San Francisco\u2019s Musee Mecanique. The music runs from Astor Piazzolla to Yma Sumac, from old standards to throaty humming, many of which never before seemed so sinister or unfamiliar.\n\nFaded carnies every one, the characters run through their paces, and at the end of the day, doff their accoutrements and sit down to amuse each other. The weary atmosphere has a tincture of forlorn sadness about it \u2013 though not of the self-pitying variety, but rather the kind that made characters like Emmett Kelly\u2019s Weary Willie or Chaplin\u2019s Little Tramp so compelling. Why do we watch them? Why do we watch sideshows? Is it that they evoke macabre fascination or empathy? And, Pinto seems to ask, what does that say about us?\n\nThanks for the review mehunt. I really enjoyed this performance. I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it as I tend not to like Euro-circus dance. (So, I just made up that dance form.) The dancers/performers were top-notch and so well rehearsed. I'm still marvelling at the dancers who performed with ribbons attached to their hands and toes. They kept the tension on the ribbons so well I thought that the ribbons were sticks. Quite amazing. I thought they used their costumes and props well, including suits without arms. The limitations the costumes provided made for very interesting movement.\n\nWelcome, joe and thanks for your comments. I enjoyed it a lot too, although I cheated a little and had seen a tape. Still, it was MUCH better live than on video, where you didn't get the full effect of the sounds. I agree about the performers -- a very impressive group!\n\nI had the good fortune to see this group perform in New Haven, CT a couple years ago. Anyone know where I might find a tour schedule so I can plan to see them the next time they on in my Washington, DC neighborhood?\n\nThe company is in the San Francisco Bay Area this week. A review from the SF Chronicle.\n\nQuote:\n\nDance review: Inbal Pinto's shaky 'Shaker'\n\nRachel Howard, Chronicle Dance Correspondent\n\nMonday, October 13, 2008\n\nA beautiful woman, a creepy old man and a mime dance a cha-cha while beefcakes in mesh bodysuits twirl toy-size parasols. If only the absurdist humor in the Inbal Pinto Dance Company's \"Shaker\" were actually funny.\n\nThe Israeli troupe, which made its second Yerba Buena Center for the Arts appearance under the auspices of San Francisco Performances on Saturday, has two co-artistic directors. Inbal Pinto, choreographer, is a product of the kinesthetically spectacular BatSheva Dance Company. Avshalom Pollak is an actor and director, presumably more responsible for the theatrical elements of the pair's evening-length collaborations, for which they also create all sets and costumes.\n\nWho is online\n\nUsers browsing this forum: No registered users and 5 guests\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot post attachments in this forum",

    "as to address this question. To this end, we studied a prehension task requiring human subjects to reach and grasp a cylindrical object presented at different locations, along variable orientations. In contrast to previous investigations, we considered the influence of the initial position of the hand. Results showed that the posture of the arm: (1) varied systematically as a function of the movement starting point; (2) was stereotyped for a particular subject given a configuration of the object and a movement starting location; (3) was altered at both the distal and proximal levels when the orientation of the object was changed; (4) was similarly influenced by the experimental factors in all the subjects, except one. When considered together, the previous results support three main conclusions: First, the nervous system solves the joint redundancy problem using fixed strategies. Second, these fixed strategies do not provide a single correspondence between hand configuration and arm posture. Third, the position and orientation of the hand in space are unlikely to be controlled through separate independent neural pathways.",

All of the CpG dinucleotides examined in the IL-4 and the IFN-gamma genes, were fully methylated over the body of the gene in all of the examined cells. However, analysis of the promoter regions of these genes revealed a different pattern. While the IL-4 promoter is fully methylated in all of the examined cells, two adjacent CpG dinucleotides near the initiation point of the IFN-gamma gene were unmethylated in all T cells, including 17-day-old fetal thymocytes. In contrast, B cells, bone marrow non-B non-T cells and liver cells displayed a full methylated profile of the IFNgamma promoter. These results suggest that the mutually exclusive pattern of IFNgamma and IL-4 production in Th(1)and Th(2)cells is not regulated by differential demethylation of these two genes.",
    "l unimodularity and Calabi-Yau condition for Poisson algebras'\n---\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nPoisson geometry is originated in classical mechanics where one describes the time evolution of a mechanical system by solving Hamilton\u00d5s equations in terms of the Hamiltonian vector field. This inspires the definition of a Poisson manifold $M$ which is equipped with a Lie bracket (called Poisson bracket) on the algebra $C^\\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on $M$ subject to the Leibniz rule. From an algebraic point of view, the structure of a Poisson bracket is understood through the following definition of a Poisson algebra.\n\nA Poisson algebra is a commutative algebra $A$ over a base field $k$, which is equipped with a bilinear map $\\{-,-\\}: A\\otimes_k A\\to A$ satisfying\n\n1.  skew symmetry: $\\{a,b\\}=-\\{b,a\\}$,\n\n2.  Jacobi identity: $\\{a,\\{b,c\\}\\}+\\{b,\\{c,a\\}\\}+\\{c,\\{a,b\\}\\}=0$,\n\n3.  Leibniz rule: $\\{ab,c\\}=a\\{b,c\\}+\\{a,c\\}b$,\n\nfor all $a,b,c\\in A$.\n\nRecently, the development of Poisson geometry has deeply entangled with noncommutative algebras and noncommutative geometry. For instance, in the deformation quantization of a Poisson algebra, the Poisson (co)homology of the Poisson algebra and the Hochschild (co)homology of its deformation quantization are connected by the Brylinsky spectral sequence [@Bry88; @EG]. As an application, Van den Bergh [@VdB94], Marconnet [@Mar04] and Berger-Pichereau [@BP11] computed the Hochschild homology of some three-dimensional Calabi-Yau algebras, by considering them as deformations of polynomial Poisson algebras with three variables respectively and computing the corresponding Poisson homology.\n\nThis prompts us to study the representation theory of a Poisson algebra $A$. Let us first recall what happens in Poisson manifold. Let $E\\to M$ be a vector bundle on a Poisson Manifold $M$, and let $\\Gamma^\\infty (E)$ be the space of smooth sections of $E$, regarded as a right finitely generated projective module over $C^\\infty(M)$. Then any Poisson vector bundle structure on $E\\to M$ is a Poisson $\\Gamma^\\infty(M)$-module structure on $\\Gamma^\\infty(E)$, or equivalently, it is a flat contravariant connection on $E$. Now we provide its algebraic version.\n\n\\[PMod\\][@Oh] Let $A$ be a Poisson algebra over a base field $k$. A left [*Poisson module*]{} $M$ over $A$ is a left $A$-module with a linear map $$\\{-, -\\}_M: A\\otimes_k M\\rightarrow M$$ satisfying\n\n1.  $\\{ \\{a, b\\}_A, m\\}_M=\\{a, \\{b, m\\}_M\\}_M-\\{b, \\{a, m\\}_M\\}_M,$\n\n2.  $\\{ab, m\\}_M=a\\{b, m\\}_M+b\\{a, m\\}_M$,\n\n3.  $\\{a, bm\\}_M=\\{a, b\\}m+b\\{a, m\\}_M$,\n\nfor any $a, b\\in A$ and $m\\in M$. For two left Poisson $A$-modules $M$ and $N$, a [*Poisson module morphism*]{} $f: M\\rightarrow N$ is an $A$-module map $f$ such that $$f(\\{a, m\\}_M)=\\{a, f(m)\\}_N$$ for any $a\\in A$ and $m\\in M$. We define $A^{op}$ to be the [*opposite Poisson algebra*]{} of $A$, where $A^{op}=A$ as commutative algebras and $\\{-,-\\}_{A^{op}}=-\\{-,-\\}_A$. Similarly, one can define right Poisson $A$-modules to be left Poisson $A^{op}$-modules. We denote by $A\\text{-PMod}$ (resp. $A^{op}\\text{-PMod}$) the category of left (resp. right) Poisson modules over $A$.\n\nThe first important result of the representation theory of a Poisson algebra $A$ is the following equivalence of categories, which enables us to express the Poisson homology and cohomology in terms of the torsion and extension groups via the universal enveloping algebra of $A$; see Definition \\[UnivP\\].\n\n[@Um Corollary 1]\\[T:Equi\\] There is an equivalence of categories $A\\text{-PMod}\\equiv \\U(A)\\text{-Mod}$, where $\\U(A)$ is the enveloping algebra of the Poisson algebra $A$.\n\nRegarding the homological behavior of a Poisson algebra, the phenomena of twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson homology and cohomology has been widely observed in many Poisson structures, i.e., polynomial Poisson algebras with quadratic Poisson structures [@LR07], affine Poisson algebras [@Zhu] and later for any polynomial Poisson algebras [@LWW]. This twisted duality enables us to decode the rich information of Poisson structures, that is carried by Poisson cohomology but hard to compute, through Poisson homology that is sometimes more computable.\n\nIn the light of Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\], we see that the representation category of a Poisson algebra $A$ is a monoidal category, where the tensor product is given by $\\otimes_A$ and the identity object is the trivial Poisson module $A$. Moreover, for any Poisson module $M$ that is a line bundle over $A$ (locally free of rank one), we have its left and right dual given by $M^*:={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(A,M)$; see . This yields the definition of the Poisson Picard group of $A$ in the following way.\n\n\\[D:PicardG\\] Let $A$ be a Poisson algebra. We define the [*Poisson Picard group*]{} of $A$, ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Pic}}}_P(A)$ to be the set of isomorphism classes of Poisson modules that are line bundles over $A$, with multiplication given by $\\otimes_A$ and inverses given by $M\\to M^*$.\n\nThroughout the paper, we are interested in affine smooth Poisson algebra $A$. In this case, the differential forms of maximal degree $\\omega_A=\\Omega_A^\\ell$ for $\\ell=\\dim A$ is a line bundle over $A$. Moreover, its inverse is given by $\\omega_A^*={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{A\\otimes A}^\\ell(A,A\\otimes A)$, which turns out to be the Serre invertible bimodule; see subsection \\[S:Rigid\\]. According to Lemma \\[PAExt\\], both $\\omega_A$ and $\\omega_A^*$ are equipped with Poisson module structures; and hence belong to the Poisson Picard group ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Pic}}}_P(A)$. The following theorem shows that $\\omega_A^*$ plays an important role in the twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality for Poisson homology and cohomology.\n\n\\[Intro:T1\\] Let $A$ be an affine smooth Poisson algebra of dimension $\\ell$. Then for any right Poisson $A$-module $M$, we have $${\\ensuremath{HP}}^{i}(M)={\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*),$$ where ${\\ensuremath{HP}}^i(M)$ is the $i$-th Poisson cohomology of $A$ with values in $M$, and ${\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M)$ is the $(\\ell-i)$-th Poisson homology of $A$ with values in the tensor product of Poisson modules $M\\otimes_A\\omega^*$.\n\nIn particular when $A$ has trivial canonical bundle, or $A$ is a commutative Calabi-Yau algebra by Proposition \\[ComCY\\], we can recover the modular derivation of $A$ [@LWW \u00a72.2] from the Poisson module structure on $\\omega_A$ by Lemma \\[L:APDer\\]. In this case, $M\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*=M^{\\delta}$, where $M^{\\delta}$ denotes the twisted Poisson module of $M$ by the modular derivation $\\delta$ of $A$; refer to Corollary \\[C:TwistD\\].\n\nOur next goal is to explore the unimodularity of a Poisson algebra. In the seminal paper [@Wein], Weinstein introduced a notion of modular class of a smooth real Poisson manifold $M$, which belongs to the $1$-th Poisson cohomology group ${\\ensuremath{HP}}^1(M)$. The notion was independently introduced by Brylinski-Zuckerman [@BZ99] in the context of complex analytic Poisson manifold. We say a Poisson manifold is unimodular if the modular class of $M$ equals zero in ${\\ensuremath{HP}}^1(M)$. Later in [@Xu99], Xu proved that any Poisson manifold that is unimodular satisfies Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson homology and cohomology.\n\nLet us return to the algebraic setting. Let $A$ be a smooth Poisson algebra that has trivial canonical bundle. When we regard the unimodularity of $A$, the $1$-th Poisson cohomology group $${\\ensuremath{HP}}^1(A)=\\{\\text{Poisson derivations} \\}/\\{\\text{Hamiltonian derivations}\\}$$ needs to be replaced by $$\\mathscr{HP}^1(A)=\\{\\text{Poisson derivations} \\}/\\{\\text{log-Hamiltonian derivations}\\}.$$ Then we can say that $A$ is unimodular if the modular class of $A$, which is represented by the modular derivation of $A$, equals zero in $\\mathscr{HP}^1(A)$. See [@Dol; @LWW]. Our Theorem \\[Intro:T1\\] reveals a closed connection between unimodularity and (untwisted) Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson homology and cohomology. Hence we provide a version of unimodularity in terms of the Poisson Picard group.\n\nLet $A$ be an affine smooth Poisson algebra. We say $A$ is [*homologically unimodular*]{} if the class of $\\omega_A$ equals zero in the Poisson Picard group ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Pic}}}_P(A)$.\n\nFinally, we study the connection between unimodularity of a Poisson algebra and Calabi-Yau condition of its enveloping algebra. Grothendieck in [@Hart] introduced dualizing complex to develop duality theory for singular curves. The noncommutative version of the dualizing complex was introduced by Yekutieli in [@Yek], and it becomes one of the standard homological tools of noncommutative ring theory. Van den Bergh later defined rigid dualizing complex for any noetherian ring [@VDB]. It appears that the existence of the rigid dualizing complex has closed relationship with Calabi-Yau algebra defined by Ginzburg [@Gin]. See Proposition \\[CYRigid\\]. The following result is obtained by applying the formula of the rigid dualizing complex for algebras of generalized differential operators [@Chem99].\n\n\\[Intro:T2\\] Let $A$ be a smooth affine Poisson algebra of dimension $\\ell$. The rigid dualizing complex of the enveloping algebra $\\U(A)$ is $$\\U(A)\\otimes_A\\mathcal L_A\\,[2\\ell],$$ where $\\mathcal L_A:=\\omega_A\\otimes_A\\omega_A$.\n\nTherefore the special class $\\omega_A$ in the Poisson Picard group ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Pic}}}_P(A)$ contributes in the rigid dualizing complex of $\\U(A)$ by a factor of two. As a consequence, the class $\\mathcal L_A\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Pic}}}_P(A)$ is involved in the twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality between Hochschild homology and cohomology of $\\U(A)$. Indeed, $\\mathcal L_A^*\\otimes_A\\U(A)$ turns out to be the Van den Bergh invertible bimodule [@VDB2] due to Corollary \\[VDBDualityH\\]. Moreover, $\\U(A)$ is a Calabi-Yau algebra if the Poisson structure of $A$ is unimodular.\n\nLet $A$ be a Calabi-Yau Poisson algebra. Then the enveloping algebra $\\U(A)$ is skew Calabi-Yau of dimension $2\\ell$ with Nakayama automorphism given by $2\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the modular derivation of $A$. Moreover, $\\U(A)$ is Calabi-Yau if the Poisson structure of $A$ is unimodular.\n\nIn the deformation quantization of a Poisson algebra, Dolgushev showed that the deformation quantization algebra is a Calabi-Yau algebra if and only if the corresponding Poisson structure is unimodular [@Dol]. Our result further confirms that unimodularity of a Poisson algebra plays the same role as Calabi-Yau condition in its representation category.\n\nWe want to make a remark that a general duality theorem is proved by Huebschmann [@Hue99] and Chemia [@Chem94; @Chem99; @Chem04] in the setting of Lie-Rinehart algebras and Lie algebroids.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Basic definitions of Poisson (co)homology, Calabi-Yau algebra and rigid dualizing complex are recalled in Section \\[S:Pre\\]. Twisted Poisson module structures are discussed in Section \\[S:Twisted\\], where we prove that the tensor $\\otimes_A$ and Hom ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(-,-)$ are two well-defined operators on the category of Poisson modules. In Section \\[S:HomM\\], we introduce the concept of homological unimodularity for any smooth affine Poisson algebra. Using the invertible Serre bimodule of a Poisson algebra, we prove the twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson homology and cohomology in Section \\[S:PoinP\\]. At the last Section \\[S:CY\\], we establish several equivalent conditions involving unimodularity of a Poisson algebra and the Calabi-Yau condition of its enveloping algebra.\n\nPreliminary {#S:Pre}\n===========\n\nThroughout the paper, we work over a base field $k$, algebraically closed of characteristic zero. The unadorned tensor product $\\otimes$ means $\\otimes_k$. We keep the notation $A$ as an affine Poisson algebra.\n\nPoisson universal enveloping algebra\n------------------------------------\n\nIn [@Oh], Oh introduced the universal enveloping algebra of $A$, denoted by $\\U(A)$. Its constructive definition in terms of generators and relations is given as follows.\n\n[@Um \u00a72]\\[UnivP\\] Let $V=A\\oplus A$ be the direct sum of two copies of $A$ with corresponding inclusions of $A$ denoted by $M$ and $H$. The [*universal enveloping algebra*]{} $\\U(A)$ of $A$ is defined to be the tensor algebra $T\\langle V\\rangle $ modulo the following relations, for all $a,b\\in A$, $$\\begin{aligned}\nM_{ab}&\\,=M_aM_b\\\\\nH_{\\{a,b\\}}&\\, =H_aH_b-H_bH_a\\\\\nH_{ab}&\\, =M_aH_b+M_bH_a\\\\\nM_{\\{a,b\\}}&\\, =H_aM_b-M_bH_a=[H_a, M_b]\\\\\nM_1&\\, =1.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe presentation of $\\U(A)$ results in an injective algebra map $M: A\\rightarrow \\U(A)$ and a Lie algebra map $H: A\\rightarrow \\U(A)$. Therefore we will simply consider $A$ as a subalgebra of $\\U(A)$. By Theorem \\[T:Equi\\], we have an equivalence of categories $A\\text{-PMod}\\equiv \\U(A)\\text{-Mod}$. Explicitly, for any $M\\in A\\text{-PMod}$, we can consider $M$ as a left $\\U(A)$-module where $a\\cdot m=am$ and $H_a\\cdot m=\\{a,m\\}_M$, for all $a\\in A$ and $m\\in M$.\n\nNow let $B$ be another Poisson algebra. The tensor algebra $A\\otimes B$ is equipped with a Poisson bracket given by $$\\{a_1\\otimes b_1,a_2\\otimes b_2\\}:=\\{a_1,a_2\\}\\otimes b_1b_2+a_1a_2\\otimes \\{b_1,b_2\\}$$ for all $a_i\\in A$ and $b_i\\in B$. In particular, $A^e:=A\\otimes A^{op}$ is a Poisson algebra. The following lemma is an application of the general result for DG Poisson algebras, which can be proved by the universal property of $\\U(A)$; see [@LWZ2 \u00a71.2].\n\n[@LWZ3 Theorem 4.5]\\[TensorU\\] There are algebra isomorphisms: $\\U(A^{op})=\\U(A)^{op}$, and $\\U(A^e)=\\U(A)\\otimes \\U(A)^{op}=:\\U(A)^e$.\n\nA [*Poisson bimodule*]{} over $A$ is a left Poisson module over $A^e$. Denote by $A^e\\text{-PMod}$ the category of all Poisson $A$-bimodules. Similarly, there is an equivalence of categories $A^e\\text{-PMod}\\equiv \\U(A)^{e}\\text{-Mod}$.\n\nThe method of localization is available for Poisson algebras. We list some of the results needed later in this paper.\n\n\\[Local\\] Let $A$ be a Poisson algebra. Suppose $S$ is a multiplicative set of $A$, $M,N$ are two Poisson $A$-modules, and $L$ is a Poisson $A$-bimodule.\n\n1.  The Poisson structure of $A$ extends uniquely to $AS^{-1}$. The set $S$ is an Ore set of $\\U(A)$ and $\\U(AS^{-1})\\cong \\U(A)S^{-1}$.\n\n2.  The localization $MS^{-1}$ is a Poisson $AS^{-1}$-module.\n\n3.  ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(A)}^*(M,L)$ is equipped with a right Poisson structure coming from $L$. And ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(A)}^*(M,L)S^{-1}\\cong {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(AS^{-1})}^*(MS^{-1},LS^{-1})$ as right Poisson $AS^{-1}$-modules.\n\n4.  For any Poisson module morphism $f: M\\to N$ and $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$, the localization $f_p:M_p\\to N_p$ is a Poisson $A_p$-module morphism . Moreover, $f$ is injective (resp. surjective) if and only if $f_p$ is injective (resp. surjective) for all $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$.\n\n5.  For any $A$-module morphism $f: M\\to N$, $f$ is a Poisson module morphism if and only if $f_p$ is a Poisson module morphism for all $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$.\n\nAll of the items can be checked directly. For (e), consider the $A$-submodule of $N$ spanned by elements $\\{a,f(m)\\}_N-f(\\{a,m\\}_M)$ for all $a\\in A,m\\in M$. Denote it by $K$. Then the condition implies that $K_p=0$ for all $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$. Hence $K=0$ and $f$ is a Poisson module morphism.\n\nRecall that the module $\\Omega_A$ of K\u00e4hler differentials of $A$ is equipped with the Lie-Rinehart algebra [@Rinehart \u00a72] structure derived from the Poisson structure of $A$. As a consequence, it is observed, by several authors [@LWZ; @Towers], that $\\U(A)$ is canonically isomorphic to the Lie-Rinehart enveloping algebra $V(A,\\Omega_A)$. For a detailed account of this isomorphism, one can refer to [@LWZ Proposition 5.7]. The advantage of identifying $\\U(A)$ with $V(A, \\Omega_A)$ is that standard results from the theory of Lie-Rinehart algebras can be applied to $\\U(A)$. For example, the algebra $V(A, \\Omega_A)$ carries a filtration which naturally passes to $\\U(A)$ via the canonical isomorphism such that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{FAPE}\n\\mathscr F_{0}=M_A,\\ \\mathscr F_{1}=M_A+H_A,\\ \\mathscr F_{i}=(\\mathscr F_{1})^i,\\ \\text{for}\\ i\\ge 2.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n\\[PBWP\\][@Rinehart Theorem 3.1] If $A$ is an affine smooth Poisson algebra, then there is an $A$-algebra isomorphism $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F} \\U(A)\\cong S_A(\\Omega_A),\\end{aligned}$$ where $S_A(\\Omega_A)$ is the symmetric $A$-algebra on $\\Omega_A$. In particular for any $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$, ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F} \\U(A_p)\\cong A_p[dx_1,dx_2,\\dots,dx_\\ell]$, where $dx_1,\\cdots,dx_\\ell$ is a local free basis for $\\Omega_{A_p}$ over $A_p$.\n\nTherefore the algebra $\\U(A)$ inherits nice ring-theoretic and homological properties from ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F} \\U(A)$ by the standard results of filtered algebras [@HO].\n\n\\[PropAPE\\] Suppose $A$ is an affine smooth Poisson algebra. Then $\\U(A)$ is projective over its subalgebra $A$. Moreover, $\\U(A)$ is a noetherian, Auslander-regular domain which is a maximal order in its quotient division ring of fractions.\n\nBy Proposition \\[PBWP\\], it is clear that the properties in the statement are satisfied for the localization of the associated graded algebra ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_\\mathscr F\\U(A)$ at any $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$. An easy exercise of localization shows that the same properties hold for ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_\\mathscr F\\U(A)$ as well. Then one can apply the standard results of Zariskian filtrations [@HO].\n\nPoisson homology and Poisson cohomology\n---------------------------------------\n\nLet $M$ be a right Poisson $A$-module. Then there is a chain complex on the $A$-module $M\\otimes_A \\Omega^n_A$, where $\\Omega^n_A=\\wedge^n \\Omega_A$ denotes the module of K\u00e4hler differential $n$-forms. The boundary operator $\\partial_n: M\\otimes_A\\Omega_A^n\\to M\\otimes_A \\Omega^{n-1}_A$ is defined by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{PHom}\n&\\partial_n(m\\otimes da_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge da_n)=\\sum_{1\\le i\\le n} (-1)^{i+1}\\{m,a_i\\}_M \\otimes da_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{da_i}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge da_n\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad+\\sum_{1\\le i<j\\le n} (-1)^{i+j} m\\otimes d\\{a_i,a_j\\}\\wedge da_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{da_i}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{da_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge da_n.\\notag\\end{aligned}$$ It is easy to see that $\\partial_{n-1}\\partial_n=0$. The homology of this complex is denoted by ${\\ensuremath{HP}}_*(M)$ and is called the [*Poisson homology*]{} of the Poisson algebra $A$ with coefficients in the Poisson module $M$ [@Mas].\n\nOn the other hand, denote by $\\mathfrak{X}^n(M)$ the space of all skew-symmetric $n$-linear maps $\\wedge^n A\\to M$ that are derivations in each argument. Then there is a cochain complex $(\\mathfrak{X}^*(M),\\delta^*)$, where $\\delta^n: \\mathfrak{X}^n(N)\\to \\mathfrak{X}^{n+1}(N)$ is defined by $$\\begin{aligned}\n&\\delta^n(f)(a_0\\wedge a_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_n)=\\sum_{0\\le i\\le n} (-1)^{i+1}\\{f(a_0\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{a_i}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_n), a_i\\}_M\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad +\\sum_{0\\le i<j\\le n} (-1)^{i+j} f(\\{a_i,a_j\\}\\wedge a_0\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{a_i}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{a_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_n)\\end{aligned}$$ for all $f\\in \\mathfrak{X}^n(M)$. One sees that $\\delta^n$ is well-defined. The cohomology of this complex is denoted by ${\\ensuremath{HP}}^*(M)$ and is called the [*Poisson cohomology*]{} of the Poisson algebra $A$ with coefficients in the Poisson module $M$ [@Lic77; @Hue].\n\nWhen $A$ is affine smooth, then Poisson homology and cohomology can be interpreted as torsion and extension groups via the enveloping algebra $\\U(A)$. First of all, $A$ can be viewed as a left $\\U(A)$-module as well as a right $\\U(A)$-module through the natural Poisson structure on $A$. By [@Rinehart Lemma 4.1], the complex $(\\U(A)\\otimes_A \\Omega^*_A,\\partial_*)$ with differentials given by ($M=\\U(A)$) is a projective resolution of $A$ in the category $\\U(A)\\text{-Mod}$. The following proposition, to our knowledge, is first explicitly spelled out in [@Hue].\n\n\\[Poissonext\\] Let $A$ be an affine smooth Poisson algebra and $M$ be a right Poisson $A$-module. Then $${\\ensuremath{HP}}_*(M)\\cong {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Tor}}}_*^{\\U(A)}(M, A),\\quad {\\ensuremath{HP}}^*(M)\\cong {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}^*_{\\U(A)^{op}}(A, M).$$\n\nCalabi-Yau algebra and rigid dualizing complex {#S:Rigid}\n----------------------------------------------\n\nLet $B$ be an associative algebra, and $B^e=B\\otimes B^{op}$. Let $M$ be a $B$-bimodule, or equivalently, a left $B^e$-module. For every pair of algebra automorphisms $\\sigma,\\tau$ of $B$, we write $\\!^\\sigma M^\\tau$ for the $B$-bimodule defined by $r\\cdot m \\cdot s = \\sigma(r)m\\tau(s)$ for all $r,s\\in B$ and $m\\in M$. When one or the other of $\\sigma,\\tau$ is the identity map, we shall simply omit it, writing for example $M^\\tau$ for $\\!^1M^\\tau$. The Van den Bergh condition will constitute a key hypothesis in Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson and Hochschild (co)homology.\n\n[@VDB2 Theorem 1]\\[VDBcondition\\] Suppose that $B$ has finite injective dimension $d$ on both sides. Then $B$ satisfies the [*Van den Bergh condition*]{} if $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{B^e}^i( B,B^e)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0   &   i\\neq d\\\\\nU &  i=d,\n\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}$$ where $U$ is an invertible $B$-bimodule, i.e., there exists another $B$-bimodule $U^{-1}$ such that $U\\otimes_BU^{-1}\\cong B\\cong U^{-1}\\otimes_BU$ as $B$-bimodules.\n\nThe definition of Calabi-Yau algebra is due to Ginzburg [@Gin].\n\n\\[CY\\] We say $B$ is [*skew Calabi-Yau*]{} (skew CY) of dimension $d$ if the following conditions hold:\n\n1.  $B$ is homologically smooth, that is, $B$ has a projective resolution in the category $B^e\\text{-Mod}$ that has finite length and such that each term in the projective resolution is finitely generated, and\n\n2.  there is an algebra automorphism $\\nu$ of $B$ such that $B$ satisfies the Van den Bergh condition with $U=B^\\nu$.\n\nIn this case, $\\nu$ is said to be the [*Nakayama automorphism*]{} of $B$ (up to some inner automorphism). Moreover, we say $B$ is [*Calabi-Yau*]{} (CY) if $\\nu$ can be chosen as an inner automorphism.\n\nDenote by $\\text{D}(B^e\\text{-Mod})$ ($\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(B^e\\text{-Mod})$) the (bounded) derived category of all $B$-bimodules. There is a close relationship between $B$ is skew CY and the existence of a rigid dualizing complex in $\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(B^e\\text{-Mod})$. The next definition is due to Yekutieli [@Yek].\n\nLet $B$ be a left and right noetherian algebra. A complex $R\\in \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(B^e\\text{-Mod})$ is called a [*dualizing complex*]{} over $B$ if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1.  $R$ has finite injective dimension over $B$ and over $B^{op}$ respectively.\n\n2.  $R$ is homologically finite over $B$ and over $B^{op}$ respectively.\n\n3.  The canonical morphisms $B \\to {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_B(R,R)$ and $B\\to {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{B^{op}}(R,R)$ are isomorphisms in $\\text{D}(B^e\\text{-Mod})$.\n\nThe next definition is due to Van den Bergh [@VDB].\n\nLet $B$ be a left and right noetherian algebra. A dualizing complex $R$ is [*rigid*]{} if $$R\\cong {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{B^e}\\left(B,\\!_B R\\otimes R_B\\right)$$ in $\\text{D}(B^e\\text{-Mod})$. The notations $\\!_BR$ and $R_B$ mean that we take the ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}$ over the left and the right $B$-structures of $R$ respectively.\n\nThe rigid dualizing complex, if it exists, is unique up to isomorphism [@VDB Proposition 8.2]. The next result is motivated by [@VDB Proposition 8.4] and [@BZ Proposition 4.3].\n\n\\[CYRigid\\] Let $B$ be a left and right noetherian algebra. Then the Van den Bergh condition holds if and only if $B$ has a rigid dualizing complex $V[s]$, where $V$ is invertible and $s\\in \\mathbb Z$. In this case $U =V^{-1}$ and $s=d$. Moreover if $B^e$ is also noetherian and has finite global dimension. Then $B$ is skew CY of dimension $d$ if and only if $B$ has a rigid dualizing complex $B^{\\sigma}[s]$ for some $\\sigma\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Aut}}}(B)$ and $s\\in \\mathbb Z$. In this case, $d=s$ and $\\sigma^{-1}$ is the Nakayama automorphism of $B$.\n\nThe first part is exactly [@BZ Proposition 4.3]. Regarding the second part, we assume $B$ to be skew CY of dimension $d$. It is well known that $B$ has finite global dimension. Then $B$ satisfies the Van den Bergh condition with $U=B^{\\nu}$, where $\\nu$ is the Nakayama automorphism of $B$. Thus it follows from the first part. Conversely, say $B$ has a rigid dualizing complex $B^{\\sigma}[s]$. Still by the first part, $B$ satisfies Definition \\[CY\\] (b). By the assumptions of $B^e$, we can find a projective resolution of $B$ in the category $B^e\\text{-Mod}$ such that it is of finite length and each term of the resolution is finitely generated. Hence $B$ is skew CY.\n\nSuppose $B$ is an affine smooth commutative algebra of dimension $d$. By [@Gin Example 3.2.1], we obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{SerreB}\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{B^e}^i(B,B^e)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0  &  i\\neq d\\\\\n\\wedge^d\\, {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_k(B)&  i=d,\n\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}$$ as $B$-modules. Note that in Serre duality, the $B$-bimodule ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{B^e}^d(B,B^{e})$ is often called the invertible Serre bimodule.

The differential forms of maximal degree of $A$ is denoted by $\\omega_A=\\wedge^\\ell \\Omega_A$. It is clear that $\\wedge^\\ell\\, {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_k(A)={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\omega_A,A):=\\omega_A^*$, Some of our results hold more generally for arbitrary Poisson algebras, but we will not state them with a specification.\n\nA [*Poisson derivation*]{} of $A$ is a derivation $\\delta\\in{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_k(A)$ satisfying $$\\delta\\{a, b\\}=\\{\\delta(a),b\\}+\\{a,\\delta(b)\\}$$ for any $a,b\\in A$. In particular, a Poisson derivation given by $u^{-1}\\{u,-\\}$ for some $u\\in A^\\times$ is called a [*log-Hamiltonian derivation*]{}.\n\nWe denote by ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$ the set of all Poisson derivations of $A$. For any $u,v\\in A^\\times$, one sees that $u^{-1}\\{u,-\\}+v^{-1}\\{v,-\\}=(uv)^{-1}\\{uv,-\\}$. Hence the set of all log-Hamiltonian derivations of $A$ forms an additive subgroup of ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$. We use $\\mathscr{HP}^1(A)$ to denote the quotient group of all Poisson derivations modulo log-Hamiltonian derivations. Note that $\\mathscr{HP}^1(A)$ differs from the $1$-th Poisson cohomology ${\\ensuremath{HP}}^1(A)={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)/\\{\\text{Hamiltonian derivations}\\}$.\n\nIn the following, we write ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$ as the set of all automorphisms $\\sigma$ of $\\U(A)$ satisfying: (i) $\\sigma$ preserves the standard filtration on $\\U(A)$, and (ii) $\\sigma={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}$ when passing to the associated graded algebra ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$. The next lemma shows that any Poisson derivation of $A$ can be derived from such automorphisms of $\\U(A)$, where log-Hamiltonian derivations correspond to those inner automorphisms.\n\n\\[ModAut\\] There is a bijection between $$\\xymatrix{\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A) \\ar@<+3pt>[rr]^{\\varphi}  && {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)\\ar@<+3pt>[ll]^{\\phi}\n}$$ given by $\\varphi(\\delta)(M_a)=M_a,\\varphi(\\delta)(H_a)=H_a+M_{\\delta(a)}$ and $M_{\\phi(f)(a)}=f(H_a)-H_a$ for any $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$, $f\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}(\\U(A))$ and $a\\in A$. Moreover, the following are bijective:\n\n1.  inner automorphisms of $\\U(A)$;\n\n2.  inner automorphisms of $\\U(A)$ in ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$;\n\n3.  log-Hamiltonian derivations of $A$.\n\nSince $M_A$ and $H_A$ are generators of $\\U(A)$, any automorphism $f\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$ is given by some linear map $\\delta: A\\to A$ such that $f(M_a)=M_a, f(H_a)=H_a+M_{\\delta(a)}$ for all $a\\in A$. Using Definition \\[UnivP\\], it is straightforward to show that $f$ is well-defined if and only if $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$.\n\nBy Proposition \\[PBWP\\], ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F} \\U(A)$ is a domain. Hence the units of $\\U(A)$ belong to $\\mathscr F_0 \\U(A)=A$, which are exactly the units of $A$. Hence any inner automorphism $f$ of $\\U(A)$ is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\nf(M_a)&=M_{u}M_aM_{u^{-1}}=M_a\\\\\nf(H_a)&=M_{u}H_aM_{u^{-1}}=(H_aM_u-M_{\\{a,u\\}})M_{u^{-1}}=H_a+M_{u^{-1}\\{u,a\\}}\\end{aligned}$$ for some $u\\in A^\\times$. Hence $f\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$ and is given by the log-Hamiltonian derivation such that $f=\\varphi(u^{-1}\\{u,-\\})$. The inverse correspondence can be proved similarly.\n\nAs a consequence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the following. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{DerInner}\n\\xymatrix{\n\\mathscr {HP}^1(A)\\ar@<+3pt>[rr]^-{\\varphi} && {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)/\\{\\text{inner automorphisms}\\}\\ar@<+3pt>[ll]^-{\\phi}.\n}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nLet $M$ be a left $\\U(A)$-module, and $\\sigma$ an automorphism of $\\U(A)$. We consider the twisted $\\U(A)$-module $\\!^\\sigma M$. Lemma \\[ModAut\\] implies that if $\\sigma \\in{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$, i.e., it is given by some $\\delta\\in{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$, then in $\\!^\\sigma M$ we have $$M_a\\cdot m=M_am,\\quad   H_a\\cdot m=H_am+M_{\\delta(a)}m$$ for all $a\\in A$ and $m\\in M$. Applying the equivalence of categories $A\\text{-PMod} \\equiv \\U(A)\\text{-Mod}$, it means that we can twist any Poisson module $(M,\\cdot,\\{-,-\\}_M)$ by some $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$ such that $$a\\cdot_\\delta m=a\\cdot m,\\  \\{a,m\\}_\\delta=\\{a,m\\}_M+\\delta(a)\\cdot m.$$ In this case, we simply write $\\!^\\delta M$ as the twisted Poisson module $(M,\\cdot_\\delta,\\{-,-\\}_\\delta)$. Note that it provides another explanation of [@LWW Proposition 2.7]. The following lemma shows that twisted Poisson module structure occurs naturally. We will use the forgetful functor from $A\\text{-PMod}$ to $A\\text{-Mod}$.\n\n\\[L:APDer\\] Let $M$ be a left (resp. right) Poisson $A$-module. If $M\\cong A$ as $A$-modules, then $M\\cong \\!^\\delta A$ (resp. $M\\cong A^\\delta$) for some $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$. Moreover, the class of $\\delta$ in $\\mathscr{HP}^1(A)$ is uniquely determined by $M$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we assume $M$ to be a left Poisson $A$-module. We can identify $M$ with $Am$ by choosing some generator $m\\in M$. Hence it establishes an isomorphism $\\varphi: M\\to A$ of left $A$-modules given by $\\varphi(am)=a$. For any $a\\in A$, there is a unique element $x\\in A$ such that $\\{a,m\\}_M=xm$. Denote $\\delta(a)=x$. It is straightforward to check that $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$ and $M\\cong \\!^\\delta A$ as Poisson modules via $\\varphi$.\n\nNow let $m'\\in M$ be another generator of $M$. Similarly, we have $M\\cong \\!^{\\delta'}A$ where $\\delta'\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$ is defined by $am'=\\delta'(a)m'$ for any $a\\in A$. After writing $m'=um$ for some $u\\in A^\\times$, it is an easy exercise to show that $\\delta-\\delta'=u^{-1}\\{u,-\\}$. This implies that $\\delta$ is uniquely determined up to some log-Hamiltonian derivation. Hence the class of $\\delta$ is unique in $\\mathscr{HP}^1(A)$.\n\nNow we list some results of the behavior of Poisson modules under the tensor and Hom functors in the category $A\\text{-Mod}$ via the forgetful functor. These results hold more generally for modules over Lie-Rinehart algebras [@Hue99 pp. 111-112] and for any Lie algebroid [@Chem04 Proposition 4.2.1]. We also state their derived versions.\n\n\\[P:THPoisson\\]\n\n-   Let $M$ be a right Poisson $A$-module and $N$ be a left Poisson $A$-module. Then $M\\otimes_AN$ is a right Poisson $A$-module via $$\\begin{aligned}\n    (m\\otimes n)a=(ma)\\otimes n=m\\otimes (an),\\quad \\{ m\\otimes n, a\\}=\\{m, a\\}_M\\otimes n-m\\otimes \\{a,n\\}_N\\end{aligned}$$ for any $m\\in M,n\\in N$ and $a\\in A$. Moreover, there are two left derived functors $$M\\otimes_A^L(-): \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A\\text{-PMod})\\to \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-PMod}),\\, (-)\\otimes_A^LN: \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-PMod})\\to \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-PMod}).$$\n\n-   Let $M,N$ be two right Poisson $A$-modules.

Moreover, there are two right derived functors $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(M,-): \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-PMod})\\to \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A\\text{-PMod}),\\, {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(-,N): \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-PMod})\\to \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A\\text{-PMod}).$$\n\nWe only prove (b) and (a) follows in the same fashion. First of all, it is straightforward to see that the Poisson left $A$-module structure is well-defined on ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M,N)$ in the sense of Definition \\[PMod\\]. Generally speaking, let $I^\\bullet$ be a acyclic complex consisting of injective modules in the category $\\U(A)^{op}\\text{-Mod}$. For each term $I^i$ in the complex $I^\\bullet$, we have $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(-,I^i_A)={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(-,{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{\\U(A)}(\\, \\!_A\\U(A),I^i))={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(-\\otimes_A\\U(A),I^i).$$ Since $\\U(A)$ is projective hence flat over $A$ by Corollary \\[PropAPE\\], one sees that ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(-,I^i_A)$ is an exact functor. Hence $I^\\bullet$ a acyclic complex consisting of injective modules in the category $A\\text{-Mod}$ via the forgetful functor. Hence the complex ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M,I^\\bullet)$ is acyclic after applying ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M,-)$ to $I^\\bullet$. Thus the right derived functor of ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M,-)$ exists by [@Hart Theorem 5.1]. The argument for ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(-,N)$ is same.\n\n\\[P:PMTwist\\] Let $\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$ be two Poisson derivations of $A$.\n\n-   Let $M$ be a right Poisson $A$-module and $N$ be a left Poisson $A$-module. Then $$(M^{\\delta_1})\\otimes_A^L (\\, \\!^{\\delta_2} N)\\cong (M\\otimes_A^LN)^{(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)}$$ in $\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-PMod})$.\n\n-   Let $M,N$ be two right Poisson $A$-modules. Then $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(M^{\\delta_1},N^{\\delta_2})\\cong\\, \\!^{(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)}\\, {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(M,N)$$ in $\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A\\text{-PMod})$.\n\nWe will prove (b) and (a) follows similarly. First of all, we show the isomorphism on the Hom level. Simply write $X={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M^{\\delta_1},N^{\\delta_2})$, $Y=\\!^{(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)}{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M,N)$ and $Z={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M,N)$. It is clear that we have natural isomorphisms of $A$-modules $X\\cong Z\\cong Y$. For any $a\\in A$, $\\phi\\in X$ and $m\\in M^{\\delta_1}$, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\{a,\\phi\\}_X(m)=&\\, \\phi(\\{m,a\\}_{\\delta_1})-\\{\\phi(m),a\\}_{\\delta_2}=\\phi(\\{m,a\\}_M+m\\delta_1(a))-\\left(\\{\\phi(m),a\\}_N+\\phi(m)\\delta_2(a)\\right)\\\\\n=&\\, \\phi(\\{m,a\\}_M)-\\{\\phi(m),a\\}_N+\\phi(m)(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)(a)=\\{a,\\phi\\}_Z(m)+[(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)(a)\\phi](m)\\\\\n=&\\, \\{a,\\phi\\}_Y(m).\\end{aligned}$$ Hence $X\\cong Y$ as left Poisson $A$-modules.\n\nMore generally, let $N\\to I^\\bullet$ be an injective resolution of $N$ in the category $\\U(A)^{op}\\text{-Mod}$. Note that $I$ is injective in the category $\\U(A)^{op}\\text{-Mod}$ if and only if $I^\\delta$ is injective in the category $\\U(A)^{op}\\text{-Mod}$ for some $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$. Hence $N^{\\delta_2}\\to (I^\\bullet)^{\\delta_2}$ is an injective resolution of $N^{\\delta_2}$ in the category $\\U(A)^{op}\\text{-Mod}$. By the argument above, we have the following isomorphisms in $\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A\\text{-PMod})$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(M^{\\delta_1},N^{\\delta_2})&\\, ={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(M^{\\delta_1},(I^\\bullet)^{\\delta_2})={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M^{\\delta_1},(I^\\bullet)^{\\delta_2})\\\\\n&\\, =\\!^{(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)}{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(M,I^\\bullet)=\\!^{(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)}{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_A(M,N).\\end{aligned}$$\n\nHomological unimodularity {#S:HomM}\n=========================\n\nWe still suppose $A$ is an affine smooth Poisson algebra of dimension $\\ell$. In this section, we study the module of differential forms of maximal degree for $A$, that is $\\omega_A=\\wedge^\\ell\\, \\Omega_A$. Note that $\\omega_A$ is a locally free $A$-module of rank one. It is a well-known fact that $\\omega_A$ is equipped with a Poisson $A$-module structure, where any element $H_a\\in \\U(A)$ acts on $\\omega_A$ as a Lie derivation by the adjoint action; see [@Bo; @Chem94]. We will explain this Poisson structure using homological algebra.\n\nLet $M$ be a Poisson $A$-bimodule, or equivalently, a $\\U(A)$-bimodule. The left and right Poisson brackets on $M$ are given by $H_am$ and $mH_a$ for any $m\\in M$ and $a\\in A$. The following lemma lies in the same fashion of Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\].\n\n\\[PAExt\\] Let $M$ be a Poisson $A$-bimodule. Then ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A^e}(A,M)$ is a right Poisson $A$-module via $$\\begin{aligned}\nm\\cdot a=ma=am,\\quad \\{m,a\\}=mH_a-H_am\\end{aligned}$$ for any $m\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A^e}(A,M)$ and $a\\in A$. Moreover, there exists a right derived functor $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{A^e}(A,-): \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^e\\text{-PMod})\\to \\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-PMod}).$$\n\nIt is direct to check that the right Poisson module structure is well-defined on ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A^e}(A,M)=\\{m\\in M\\,|\\,am=ma\\, \\forall\\, a\\in A\\}$ with respect to Definition \\[PMod\\]. Now consider a acyclic complex $I^\\bullet$ consisting of injective objects in the category $\\U(A)^e\\text{-Mod}$. By Corollary \\[PropAPE\\], $\\U(A)^e=\\U(A^e)$ is projective hence flat over $A^e$ via the forgetful functor. Hence the complex ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A^e}(A,I^\\bullet)$ is acyclic. Thus the right derived functor of ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A^e}(A,-)$ exists by [@Hart Theorem 5.1].\n\nNote that the tensor algebra $A^e=A\\otimes A^{op}$ is a Poisson $A$-bimodule, or equivalently, a left module over $\\U(A^e)=\\U(A)^e$ by Lemma \\[TensorU\\]. Therefore we can take $M=A^e$ in Lemma \\[PAExt\\]. It is clear that the right Poisson bracket on ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A^e}(A,A^e)$ is given by the adjoint action. Next apply to get $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{A^e}^i(A,A^e)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0  &  i\\neq \\ell\\\\\n\\wedge^\\ell\\, {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_k(A)=\\omega_A^*&  i=\\ell\n\\end{cases}.$$ Hence $\\omega_A^*$ is a right Poisson $A$-module, where the Poisson bracket is induced by the adjoint action. It follows from Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\] (b), one sees that $\\omega_A={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\omega_A^*,A)$ is a left Poisson $A$-module.\n\nNow choose any $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$. We know $\\Omega_{A_p}$ is a free $A_p$-module of rank $\\ell$, and $\\omega_{A_p}\\cong A_{p}$ as $A_{p}$-modules. Hence $\\omega_{A_p}\\cong \\!^{\\delta} A_{p}$ for some $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A_p)$ by Lemma \\[L:APDer\\].\n\n\\[LMD\\] The [*local modular derivation*]{} of $A$ at some $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$ is defined to be the Poisson derivation $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A_p)$ such that $\\omega_{A_p}\\cong \\!^\\delta A_p$ as left Poisson $A_p$-modules. Moreover, the [*local modular class*]{} of $A$ is the class of $\\delta$ in $\\mathscr{HP}^1(A_p)$.\n\nAs a consequence, the local Poisson structure on $\\omega_A$ is uniquely determined by the local modular class of $A$.\n\n\\[LMDF\\] Let $A$ be an affine smooth Poisson algebra, and $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$. Suppose $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_\\ell$ is a regular system of parameters of $A_p$. Then the local modular derivation $\\delta$ of $A$ at $p$ is uniquely determined, up to some log-Hamiltonian derivation, by its values on $x_1,\\dots,x_\\ell$. Moreover, we have $\\delta(x_i)=\\sum_{1\\le j\\le \\ell} a_{ijj}$, where coefficients $a_{ijk}\\in A_p$ are given by $d\\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\sum_{1\\le k\\le \\ell}a_{ijk}dx_k$ in the module of K\u00e4hler differentials of $A_p$.\n\nNote that $A_p$ is a regular local algebra, whose unique maximal ideal is generated by its regular system of parameters $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_\\ell$. Since every element of $A_p$ can be represented as a rational function in terms of $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_\\ell$, it is clear that any derivation of $A_p$ is uniquely determined by its values on $x_1,\\dots,x_\\ell$. This applies to the local modular derivation $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A_p)$.\n\nSince $dx_1,\\dots,dx_\\ell$ forms a free basis for the K\u00e4hler differential $\\Omega_{A_p}$ of $A_p$, one sees that $dx_1\\wedge dx_2\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell$ is a basis for the differential forms of maximal order $\\omega_A$; and hence is a dual basis for $\\omega_{A_p}^*$. By applying the standard Koszul resolution of $A_p$, one concludes that the local modular derivation $\\delta$ is determined, up to some log-Hamiltonian derivation, by the adjoint action such that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta(a) dx_1\\wedge dx_2\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell=\\sum_{1\\le i\\le \\ell} (-1)^{i+1} d(\\{a,x_i\\}\\, dx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_i}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell)\\end{aligned}$$ for any $a\\in A_p$. In particular, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta(x_i) dx_1\\wedge dx_2\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell&\\, =\\sum_{1\\le j\\le \\ell}  (-1)^{j+1} d(\\{x_i,x_j\\}\\, dx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell)\\\\\n&\\, =\\sum_{1\\le j\\le \\ell} (-1)^{j+1} d(\\sum_{k=1}^\\ell a_{ijk}\\, x_kdx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell)\\\\\n&\\, =\\sum_{1\\le j\\le \\ell} (-1)^{j+1} a_{ijj}\\,dx_j\\wedge dx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell\\\\\n&\\, =(\\sum_{1\\le j\\le \\ell}  a_{ijj})\\, dx_1\\wedge dx_2\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell.\\end{aligned}$$ Hence $\\delta(x_i)=\\sum_{1\\le j\\le \\ell} a_{ijj}$.\n\nIn particular when $A$ is CY, then $A$ has trivial canonical bundle by Proposition \\[ComCY\\]. Hence the Poisson structure on $\\omega_A\\cong \\!^\\delta A$ is uniquely determined, up to some log-Hamiltonian derivation, by one single $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A)$. In [@LWW \u00a72.2], the Poisson derivation $\\delta$ is said to be the [*modular derivation*]{} of $A$.

We use the complex $\\U(B)\\otimes_B \\Omega_B^\\bullet\\to B$ with differentials described in ($M=\\U(B)$) as a projective resolution of $B$ in the category $\\U(B)\\text{-Mod}$. Therefore, we obtain the following commutative diagram of exact rows $$\\xymatrix{\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_B(\\Omega_B^{\\ell-1},\\U(B))\\ar[r]^-{\\partial}\\ar@{=}[d] &  {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_B(\\Omega_B^\\ell,\\U(B))\\ar[r]\\ar@{=}[d]  &   {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(B)}^\\ell(B,\\U(B))\\ar[r]\\ar[r]\\ar@{=}[d]  &  0\\\\\n\\bigoplus_{i=1}^\\ell e_i\\, \\U(B)\\ar[r]^-{\\partial} & e\\, \\U(B) \\ar[r]  &   {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(B)}^\\ell(B,\\U(B))\\ar[r] &  0,\n}$$ where the differential $\\partial$ can be explicitly given as follows $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial(e_i)/e&\\,=\\delta_{e_i}(\\partial(e))\\\\\n&\\,=\\delta_{e_i}(\\sum_{1\\le j\\le \\ell}(-1)^{j+1}e_jH_{x_j}+\\sum_{1\\le j<k\\le \\ell} (-1)^{j+k} d\\{x_j,x_k\\}\\wedge dx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_k}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell)\\\\\n&\\,=(-1)^{i+1}H_{x_i}+\\delta_{e_i}(\\sum_{\\substack{1\\le j<k\\le \\ell\\\\ 1\\le m\\le \\ell}} (-1)^{j+k} a_{jkm}dx_m\\wedge dx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_k}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell)\\\\\n&\\,=(-1)^{i+1}H_{x_i}+\\delta_{e_i}(\\sum_{1\\le j<k\\le \\ell} (-1)^{j+k} a_{jkj}dx_j\\wedge dx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_k}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad+ \\sum_{1\\le j<k\\le \\ell} (-1)^{j+k} a_{jkk}dx_k\\wedge dx_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_j}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\widehat{dx_k}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx_\\ell)\\\\\n&\\,=(-1)^{i+1}H_{x_i}+\\delta_{e_i}(\\sum_{1\\le j<k\\le \\ell} (-1)^{k+1} a_{jkj}e_k+ \\sum_{1\\le j<k\\le \\ell} (-1)^{j} a_{jkk}e_j)\\\\\n&\\,=(-1)^{i+1}H_{x_i}+\\sum_{1\\le j<i\\le \\ell} (-1)^{i+1} a_{jij}+ \\sum_{1\\le i<k\\le \\ell} (-1)^{i} a_{ikk}\\\\\n&\\,=(-1)^{i+1}(H_{x_i}-\\sum_{1\\le j\\le\\ell} a_{ijj})\\\\\n&\\,=(-1)^{i+1}(H_{x_i}-\\delta(x_i)).\\end{aligned}$$ In the above calculation, we use the fact that $a_{ijk}=-a_{jik}$. Note that $\\U(B)$ is generated by $B$ and $H_{x_1},\\dots, H_{x_\\ell}$ by Proposition \\[PBWP\\] and the local modular derivation $\\delta$ is uniquely determined by $\\delta(x_1),\\dots,\\delta(x_\\ell)$ by Lemma \\[LMDF\\]. As a conclusion, we have $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{B^e}^\\ell(B,B^e) \\cong B^\\delta \\cong \\U(B)/(H_{x_i}-\\delta(x_i))_{1\\le i\\le \\ell}\\cong {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(B)}^\\ell(B,\\U(B)).$$ as right Poisson $B$-modules.\n\nFinally, we define the global $A$-module map $\\varphi: {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{A^e}^i(A,A^e)\\to  {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(A)}^i(A,\\U(A))$ as $\\varphi=0$ when $i\\neq \\ell$ and when $i=\\ell$, $\\varphi$ is the composition of the following maps. $$\\xymatrix{\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{A^e}^\\ell(A,A^e)={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\omega_A,A)\\ar@{^{(}->}[r] & {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\omega_A,\\U(A))\\ar@{->>}[r] &  {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(A)}^\\ell(A,\\U(A)).\n}$$ By the arguments above, any localization of $\\varphi$ is a Poisson module isomorphism over the localized Poisson algebra. Hence the statement follows from Lemma \\[Local\\], and the derived version is obvious.\n\nIn the theory of Lie-Rinehart algebras, there is a correspondence (analogous to Bernstein\u00d5s correspondence for $\\mathcal D$-modules) between left and right Lie-Rinehart modules using the Berezinian module of the dual sheaf of the Lie algebras [@Chem94]. We reformulate it in the context of Poisson algebras by using any Poisson $A$-modules which are line bundles over $A$.\n\n\\[EquivMod\\] Let $S$ be a right Poisson $A$-module. If $S$ is a locally free $A$-module of rank one, then the following two functors $F: A\\text{-PMod}\\to A^{op}\\text{-PMod}$ and $G:A^{op}\\text{-PMod}\\to A\\text{-PMod}$ defined by $F(-)=S\\otimes_A(-)$ and $G(-)={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(S,-)$ with Poisson $A$-modules structures given by Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\] is an equivalence of categories. As a consequence, there is an equivalence of bounded derived categories $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\xymatrix{\n\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A\\text{-Mod})\\ar@<+3pt>[rr]^-{F} &&\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(A^{op}\\text{-Mod})\\ar@<+3pt>[ll]^-{G}.\n}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince $S$, considered as a right $A$-module, is locally free of rank one, it is straightforward to check that $GF={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}$ on $A\\text{-PMod}$ and $FG={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Id}}}$ on $A^{op}\\text{-PMod}$ by applying the method of localization in . The derived version follows immediately.\n\nWhen $S=A$, we will simply identify $(-)=A\\otimes_A(-)$ and $(-)={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(A,-)$ between left and right Poisson modules. For instance, the original right Poisson module $\\omega_A^*$ can be considered as a left Poisson module, where ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(A, \\omega_A^*)=\\omega_A^*$ as vector spaces and $am=ma$, $\\{a,m\\}=-\\{m,a\\}$ for any $a\\in A$ and $m\\in \\omega_A^*$. In the remaining of the paper, we will freely switch between left and right Poisson modules when we apply Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\]. In particular, it is an easy exercise to show that the corresponding left module for a twisted right Poisson module $M^\\delta$ is given by $\\!^{-\\delta}M$ and vice visa.\n\n\\[TwistedP\\] Let $A$ be an affine smooth Poisson algebra of dimension $\\ell$. Then for any right Poisson $A$-module $M$, we have $${\\ensuremath{HP}}^{i}(M)={\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*).$$ In particular if $A$ is homologically unimodular, then we have the Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson homology and cohomology $${\\ensuremath{HP}}^{i}(M)={\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M).$$\n\nIn view of Proposition \\[Poissonext\\], it is convenient to make use of the derived category. $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\ensuremath{HP}}^i(M)&\\, ={\\ensuremath{H}}^i({\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{\\U(A)^{op}}(A,M))={\\ensuremath{H}}^i({\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{\\U(A)}(A,M))\\\\\n&\\, ={\\ensuremath{H}}^i({\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{\\U(A)}(A,\\U(A))\\otimes_{\\U(A)}^L M)={\\ensuremath{H}}^i({\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{A^e}(A,A^e)\\otimes_{\\U(A)}^L M)\\\\\n&\\,={\\ensuremath{H}}^i(\\omega_A^*[-\\ell]\\otimes_{\\U(A)}^L M)={\\ensuremath{H}}^{i-\\ell}(\\omega_A^*\\otimes_{\\U(A)}^L M)={\\ensuremath{H}}^{i-\\ell}(M\\otimes_{\\U(A)}^L \\omega_A^*)\\\\\n&\\, ={\\ensuremath{H}}^{i-\\ell}((M\\otimes_A^L \\omega_A^*)\\otimes_{\\U(A)}^L A)={\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M\\otimes_A\\omega_A^*).\\end{aligned}$$ We use the fact that $M\\otimes_{\\U(A)}\\omega_A^*\\cong (M\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*)\\otimes_{\\U(A)}A$ and $(-)\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*: \\U(A)^{op}\\text{-Mod}\\to \\U(A)^{op}\\text{-Mod}$ is an equivalence of categories by a left module version of Lemma \\[EquivMod\\].\n\nIn particular if $A$ is homologically unimodular, then $\\omega_A\\cong A$ as left Poisson modules. Hence $\\omega_A^*={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\omega_A,A)\\cong A$ as left Poisson modules, which implies the Poincar\u00e9 duality.\n\nThe twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson homology and cohomology was studied by Launois-Richard [@LR07] for polynomial Poisson algebras with quadratic Poisson structures. Following their ideas, Zhu [@Zhu] obtained a twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality for affine Poisson algebras, and later it was proved for any polynomial Poisson algebras with values in an arbitrary Poisson module by Luo-Wang-Wu [@LWW]. The following result provides a generalization of the twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality for all CY Poisson algebras.\n\n\\[C:TwistD\\] Let $A$ be a CY Poisson algebra of dimension $\\ell$, and $M$ a right Poisson $A$-module. Then we have the twisted Poincar\u00e9 duality between Poisson homology and cohomology $${\\ensuremath{HP}}^{i}(M)={\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M^\\delta),$$ where $\\delta$ is the modular derivation of $A$.\n\nNow $A$ is CY. By Proposition \\[ComCY\\] and Lemma \\[L:APDer\\], we know $\\omega_A\\cong \\!^\\delta A$ as left Poisson modules, where $\\delta$ is the modular derivation of $A$. By a right version of Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\] (b), one sees that $\\omega_A^*={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\!^\\delta A,A)\\cong A^\\delta$ as right Poisson modules. In view of Lemma \\[EquivMod\\] ($S=A$), we have $\\omega_A^*\\cong \\!^{-\\delta}A$ as left Poisson modules. Now it is an easy exercise to check that $M\\otimes_A \\!^{-\\delta}A\\cong M^\\delta$ as right Poisson modules following Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\] (a). Hence ${\\ensuremath{HP}}^i(M)={\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M\\otimes_A \\!^{-\\delta}A)={\\ensuremath{HP}}_{\\ell-i}(M^\\delta)$ by Theorem \\[TwistedP\\].\n\nCalabi-Yau condition {#S:CY}\n====================\n\nIn this section, we use the rigid dualizing complex of the enveloping algebra $\\U(A)$ to explore its Calabi-Yau property. We show that there is a strong connection between the unimodularity of $A$ and the Calabi-Yau property of $\\U(A)$.\n\n\\[GradedCY\\] For any affine smooth Poisson algebra $A$ of dimension $\\ell$, the associated graded algebra ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$ has a rigid dualizing complex $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)\\otimes_A (\\omega_A\\otimes_A\\omega_A)[2\\ell].$$ In particular if $A$ is CY, then ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape gr}}}_{\\mathscr F}\\U(A)$ is CY.\n\nIt suffices to show for $B:= S_A(\\Omega_A)$ by Proposition \\[PBWP\\]. We define the following map $$\\varphi: \\Omega_B\\to B\\otimes_A\\left(\\Omega_A\\oplus \\Omega_A\\right)$$ first on the generators of $\\Omega_B$ such that $\\varphi(da)=1\\otimes (da+0)$ and $\\varphi(d\\alpha)=1\\otimes (0+\\alpha)$ for any $a\\in A$ and $\\alpha\\in\\Omega_A$. Then one checks that $\\varphi$ can be extended to a well-defined $B$-module map on $\\Omega_B$. Now consider $\\varphi$ as an $A$-module map. The localization of $B$ at any $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$ implies that $B_p=S_{A_p}(\\Omega_{A_p})\\cong A_p[dx_1,\\dots,dx_\\ell]$ by Proposition \\[PBWP\\]. Hence $\\Omega_{B_p}$ is a free $B_p$-module of rank $2\\ell$ and the localization $\\varphi_p$ yields $\\varphi_p: B_p^{\\oplus 2\\ell}\\to B_p^{\\oplus 2\\ell}$, which is easy to be checked as an isomorphism. Therefore $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism of $A$-modules; and hence it is an isomorphism of $B$-modules. Since $B$ is affine smooth, by the comment above Proposition \\[ComCY\\], the rigid dualizing complex of $B$ is given by $2\\ell$ shifting of $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\wedge^{2\\ell}\\, \\Omega_B&\\, =\\wedge^{2\\ell} B\\otimes_A(\\Omega_A\\oplus \\Omega_A)=B\\otimes _A \\wedge^{2\\ell}(\\Omega_A\\oplus \\Omega_A)\\\\\n&\\,=B\\otimes _A (\\wedge^{\\ell}\\Omega_A \\otimes _A \\wedge^\\ell \\Omega_A)=B\\otimes_ A (\\omega_A\\otimes_A\\omega_A).\\end{aligned}$$ Moreover, when $A$ is CY, we know $\\omega_A=A$, then it follows from Proposition \\[ComCY\\] since the rigid dualizing complex of $B$ is $B[2\\ell]$.\n\nGenerally, suppose $S$ is a Poisson $A$-module that is a locally free $A$-module of rank one. In the following, we denote by $S^*={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(S,A)$ the dual module of $S$, which is also a locally free $A$-module of rank one; and its has again a Poisson module structure due to Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\]. We will not specify on which side is the Poisson module structure of $S$ or $S^*$, but will leave to the context making use of the comment below Lemma \\[EquivMod\\]. The next result verifies .\n\n\\[RankonePMod\\] Let $S$ or $S_i$ be Poisson modules over $A$, which are locally free $A$-modules of rank one. We have the following isomorphisms of Poisson $A$-modules.\n\n1.  $S\\otimes A\\cong S\\cong A\\otimes_AS$;\n\n2.  $S\\otimes_A S^*\\cong A\\cong S^*\\otimes_A S$;\n\n3.  $(S_1\\otimes_A S_2)^*\\cong S_2^*\\otimes_A S_1^*$;\n\n4.  ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(S_1,S_2)\\cong S_1^*\\otimes_A S_2$;\n\n5.  ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(S_1,S_2)^*\\cong {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}(S_2,S_1)$.\n\nMoreover if $U$ is an invertible Poisson bimodules over $A$, then $(S\\otimes_A U)^{-1}=U^{-1}\\otimes_A S^*$.\n\nFor any $p\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$, the localization $S_p\\cong A_p$ is equipped with the Poisson module structure given by some local Poisson derivation $\\delta\\in {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A_p)$ by Lemma \\[L:APDer\\]. Hence we can prove all the claims by localization. For instance in (b), there is natural map $\\varphi: S\\otimes_A S^*\\to A$ given by evaluation. Let $S_p\\cong A^\\delta_p$ for some local Poisson derivation $\\delta\\in{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Der}}}_P(A_p)$. By Corollary \\[P:PMTwist\\], we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\varphi_p: S_p \\otimes_A {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A_p}(S_p,A_p)&\\, =A_p^{\\delta} \\otimes_A {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A_p}(A_p^\\delta,A_p)=A_p^{\\delta} \\otimes_A \\!^\\delta\\, {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A_p}(A_p,A_p)\\\\\n&\\, =A_p\\otimes_A {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_{A_p}(A_p,A_p)\\to A_p\\end{aligned}$$ is clearly an isomorphism of Poisson modules. Hence $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism of Poisson modules by Lemma \\[Local\\]. We can prove $S^*\\otimes_A S\\cong A$ analogously.\n\nBefore we state our results, let us set up the convection for the structure of Poisson bimodules concerning the tensor product $S\\otimes_A \\U(A)$ (resp. $\\U(A)\\otimes_A S$) for any Poisson module $S$ that is a line bundle over $A$. We require that the right Poisson structure of $S\\otimes \\U(A)$ (resp. $\\U(A)\\otimes S$) is derived from the right (resp. left) multiplication of $\\U(A)$ and the left (resp. right) $\\U(A)$-module structure is determined by the tensor product with possible switching side of Poisson module structures regarding $S$ and Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\] by applying the comment below Lemma \\[EquivMod\\].\n\nNow according to , one sees that $(S\\otimes_A \\U(A))[d]$ and $(\\U(A)\\otimes_A S)[d]$ for any $d\\in \\mathbb Z$ are all dualizing complexes in $\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(\\U(A)^e\\text{-Mod})$. As suggested by Lemma \\[GradedCY\\], the line bundle $S=\\mathcal L_A$ such that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{CYdualmod}\n\\mathcal L_A:=\\omega_A\\otimes_A\\omega_A={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\omega_A^*,\\omega_A)\\end{aligned}$$ plays a significant role in the rigid dualizing complex of $\\U(A)$. Clearly, $\\mathcal L_A$ is equipped with a left Poisson module structure with respect to Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\] (b) when we treat both $\\omega_A^*$ and $\\omega_A$ as right Poisson modules. By Lemma \\[RankonePMod\\], the dual module of $\\mathcal L_A$ is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{CYdualdualmod}\n\\mathcal L_A^*=\\omega_A^*\\otimes_A\\omega_A^*={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\omega_A,\\omega_A^*).\\end{aligned}$$ In particular when $A$ is CY, then $\\mathcal L_A={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(A^{\\delta},A^{-\\delta})=\\!^{2\\delta }A$ as left Poisson modules, or $\\mathcal L_A=A^{-2\\delta}$ as right Poisson modules, where $\\delta$ is the modular derivation of $A$.\n\n\\[VDBP\\] For any affine smooth Poisson algebra $A$ of dimension $\\ell$, we have $${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{\\U(A)^{op}}(A,{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{A^e}(A,\\U(A)^e))=\\U(A)\\otimes_A\\mathcal L_A^*[-2\\ell]$$ in $\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(\\U(A)^e\\text{-Mod})$.\n\nIn view of , it is easy to check that the left hand side above is well-defined. Since $\\U(A)^{e}=\\U(A^e)$ is flat over $A^e$ by Corollary \\[PropAPE\\], we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{A^e}(A,\\U(A)^e)&\\, ={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{A^e}(A,A^e\\otimes_{A^e} \\U(A)^e)\\\\\n&\\, ={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{A^e}(A,A^e)\\otimes_{A^e}^L \\U(A)^e\\\\\n&\\, =\\omega_A^*\\,[-\\ell]\\otimes_{A^e}^L \\U(A)^e\\\\\n&\\, =(\\U(A)\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*)\\otimes_A \\U(A)\\, [-\\ell].\\end{aligned}$$ Note that for the last equality above, the right $\\U(A)$-module structure is determined by Proposition \\[P:THPoisson\\] (b) when $\\omega_A^*$ is considered as a left $\\U(A)$-module. Next we get $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{\\U(A)^{op}}(A,{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{A^e}(A,\\U(A)^e))&\\, ={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{\\U(A)^{op}}(A,(\\U(A)\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*)\\otimes_A \\U(A)\\,[-\\ell])\\\\\n&\\, =(\\U(A)\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*)\\otimes_A^L{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape RHom}}}_{\\U(A)^{op}}(A, \\U(A))\\,[-\\ell]\\\\\n&\\, =(\\U(A)\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*)\\otimes_A (\\omega_A^*\\,[-\\ell])\\,[-\\ell]\\\\\n&\\, =(\\U(A)\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*)\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*\\,[-2\\ell]\\\\\n&\\, =\\U(A)\\otimes_A (\\omega_A^*\\otimes_A \\omega_A^*)\\,[-2\\ell]\\\\\n&\\, =\\U(A)\\otimes_A \\mathcal L_A^*\\,[-2\\ell].\n$$\n\nThe following result has been proved in a general setting for Lie-Rinehart Lie (super)algebras [@Chem94; @Chem99].

The affine variety is $X={\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Spec}}}(A)$. The sheaf of Lie algebras is given by $\\mathcal L_X=\\widetilde{\\Omega_A}$, which is a locally free $\\mathcal O_X$-module of rank $d_{\\mathcal L_X}=\\ell$.

The sheaf of differential operators $\\mathcal D(\\mathcal L_X)$ is the $\\mathcal O_X$-algebra $\\widetilde{\\U(A)}$ and we have $$\\wedge^{d_{\\mathcal L_X}} \\mathcal L_X^*=\\left(\\wedge^\\ell {\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Hom}}}_A(\\Omega_A,A)\\right)^{\\widetilde{}}=\\widetilde{\\omega_A^*}.$$ Note that both $\\wedge^{d_{\\mathcal L_X}} \\mathcal L_X^*$ and $\\omega_X=\\omega_A$ are $\\mathcal D(\\mathcal L_X)$-modules, where any $D\\in \\mathcal L_X$ acts as a Lie derivation by adjoint action.

The module class of $A$ is zero.\n\n3.  $\\omega_A\\cong A$ as left Poisson modules over $A$.\n\n4.  $\\omega_A^*\\cong A$ as right Poisson modules over $A$.\n\n5.  ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(A)}^\\ell (A,\\U(A))\\cong A$ as right Poisson modules over $A$.\n\n6.  ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{\\U(A)^{op}}^\\ell (A,\\U(A))\\cong A$ as left Poisson modules over $A$.\n\n7.  ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{A^e}(A,A^e)\\cong A$ as right Poisson modules over $A$.\n\n8.  $\\U(A)$ is CY of dimension $2\\ell$ provided that for any $u\\in A^\\times$, $\\sqrt{u}$ exits.\n\n(a)$\\Leftrightarrow$(b) comes from definition. (c)$\\Leftrightarrow$(d) and (e)$\\Leftrightarrow$(f) follows from duality of left and right Poisson modules regarding Lemma \\[EquivMod\\]. (d)$\\Leftrightarrow$(e) is derived from Proposition \\[ExtEq\\]. Lemma \\[HomU\\] implies that (a)$\\Leftrightarrow$(e) since $A$ is CY. By Definition \\[LMD\\] and the comment below Lemma \\[LMDF\\], we know ${\\ensuremath{\\text{\\upshape Ext}}}_{A^e}(A,A^e)=\\omega_A^*$ as right Poisson modules, hence (d)$\\Leftrightarrow$(g). Finally, it suffices to prove (a)$\\Leftrightarrow$(h). By Corollary \\[SCYP\\], we know $\\U(A)$ is skew CY with Nakayama automorphism given by $2\\delta$ in the sense of Lemma \\[ModAut\\], where $\\delta$ is the modular derivation of $A$. In this case by , $\\U(A)$ is CY if and only if $2\\delta$ is given by some inner automorphism of $\\U(A)$ if and only if $2\\delta=u^{-1}\\{u,-\\}$ for some $u\\in A^\\times$ if and only if $\\delta=v^{-1}\\{v,-\\}$ for $v=\\sqrt{u}$ if and only if $A$ is unimodular.\n\n\\[CYUni\\] For a polynomial Poisson algebra $A=\\k[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$, its units are given by $A^\\times=\\k^\\times$. Thus we know a polynomial Poisson algebra is unimodular if and only if its enveloping algebra is CY. Generally speaking, by the proof of , one sees that the unimodularity of the Poisson structure always implies the CY property of its enveloping algebra, but the inverse direction may not hold.\n\nThe second author is grateful for the hospitality of the first author at Zhejiang Normal University summer 2016 during the time the paper is written .

    "ctuators, 88 (2003), pp. 1-20, which publication is hereby incorporated herein by reference.\nFIG. 1 illustrates a cross-section of a p-type (p-channel) ISFET 50 fabricated using a conventional CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) process. P-type ISFET fabrication is based on a p-type silicon substrate 52, in which an n-type well 54 forming a transistor \u201cbody\u201d is formed. Highly doped p-type (p+) regions S and D, constituting a source 56 and a drain 58 of the ISFET, are formed within the n-type well 54. A highly doped n-type (n+) region B is also formed within the n-type well to provide a conductive body (or \u201cbulk\u201d) connection 62 to the n-type well. An oxide layer 65 is disposed above the source, drain and body connection regions, through which openings are made to provide electrical connections (via electrical conductors) to these regions; for example, metal contact 66 serves as a conductor to provide an electrical connection to the drain 58, and metal contact 68 serves as a conductor to provide a common connection to the source 56 and n-type well 54, via the highly conductive body connection 62. A polysilicon gate 64 is formed above the oxide layer at a location above a region 60 of the n-type well 54, between the source 56 and the drain 58. Because it is disposed between the polysilicon gate 64 and the transistor body (i.e., the n-type well), the oxide layer 65 often is referred to as the \u201cgate oxide.\u201d\nLike a MOSFET, the operation of an ISFET is based on the modulation of charge concentration caused by a MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) capacitance constituted by the polysilicon gate 64, the gate oxide 65 and the region 60 of the n-type well 54 between the source and the drain. When a negative voltage is applied across the gate and source regions (VGS<0 Volts), a \u201cp-channel\u201d 63 is created at the interface of the region 60 and the gate oxide 65 by depleting this area of electrons. This p-channel 63 extends between the source and the drain, and electric current is conducted through the p-channel when the gate-source potential VGS is negative enough to attract holes from the source into the channel. The gate-source potential at which the channel 63 begins to conduct current is referred to as the transistor's threshold voltage VTH (the transistor conducts when VGS has an absolute value greater than the threshold voltage VTH). The source is so named because it is the source of the charge carriers (holes for a p-channel) that flow through the channel 63; similarly, the drain is where the charge carriers leave the channel 63.\nIn the ISFET 50 of FIG. 1, the n-type well 54 (transistor body), via the body connection 62, is forced to be biased at a same potential as the source 56 (i.e., VSB=0 Volts), as seen by the metal contact 68 connected to both the source 56 and the body connection 62. This connection prevents forward biasing of the p+ source region and the n-type well, and thereby facilitates confinement of charge carriers to the area of the region 60 in which the channel 63 may be formed. Any potential difference between the source 56 and the body/n-type well 54 (a non-zero source-to-body voltage VSB) affects the threshold voltage VTH of the ISFET according to a nonlinear relationship, and is commonly referred to as the \u201cbody effect,\u201d which in many applications is undesirable.\nAs also shown in FIG. 1, the polysilicon gate 64 of the ISFET 50 is coupled to multiple metal layers disposed within one or more additional oxide layers 75 disposed above the gate oxide 65 to form a \u201cfloating gate\u201d structure 70. The floating gate structure is so named because it is electrically isolated from other conductors associated with the ISFET; namely, it is sandwiched between the gate oxide 65 and a passivation layer 72. In the ISFET 50, the passivation layer 72 constitutes an ion-sensitive membrane that gives rise to the ion-sensitivity of the device; i.e., the presence of ions in an \u201canalyte solution\u201d 74 (a solution containing ions of interest) in contact with the passivation layer 72, particularly in a sensitive area 78 above the floating gate structure 70, alters the electrical characteristics of the ISFET so as to modulate a current flowing through the p-channel 63 between the source 56 and the drain 58. The passivation layer 72 may comprise any one of a variety of different materials to facilitate sensitivity to particular ions; for example, passivation layers comprising silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride generally provide sensitivity to hydrogen ion concentration (pH) in the analyte solution 74, whereas passivation layers comprising polyvinyl chloride containing valinomycin provide sensitivity to potassium ion concentration in the analyte solution (materials suitable for passivation layers and sensitive to other ions such as sodium, silver, iron, bromine, iodine, calcium, and nitrate, for example, are known).\nWith respect to ion sensitivity, an electric potential difference, commonly referred to as a \u201csurface potential,\u201d arises at the solid/liquid interface of the passivation layer 72 and the analyte solution 74 as a function of the ion concentration in the sensitive area 78 due to a chemical reaction (e.g., usually involving the dissociation of oxide surface groups by the ions in the analyte solution in proximity to the sensitive area 78). This surface potential in turn affects the threshold voltage VTH of the ISFET; thus, it is the threshold voltage VTH of the ISFET that varies with changes in ion concentration in the analyte solution 74 in proximity to the sensitive area 78.\nFIG. 2 illustrates an electric circuit representation of the p-channel ISFET 50 shown in FIG. 1. With reference again to FIG. 1, a reference electrode 76 (a conventional Ag/AgCl electrode) in the analyte solution 74 determines the electric potential of the bulk of the analyte solution itself and is analogous to the gate terminal of a conventional MOSFET, as shown in FIG. 2. In a linear or non-saturated operating region of the ISFET, the drain current ID is given as:ID=\u03b2(VGS\u2212VTH\u2212\u00bdVDS)VDS,\u2003\u2003(1)\nwhere VDS is the voltage between the drain and the source, and \u03b2 is a transconductance parameter (in units of Amps/Volts2) given by:\n                              \u03b2          =                      \u03bc            \u2062                                                  \u2062                                          C                ox                            \u2061                              (                                  W                  L                                )                                                    ,                            (        2        )            \nwhere \u03bc represents the carrier mobility, Cox is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, and the ratio W/L is the width to length ratio of the channel 63. If the reference electrode 76 provides an electrical reference or ground (VG=0 Volts), and the drain current ID and the drain-to-source voltage VDS are kept constant, variations of the source voltage VS of the ISFET directly track variations of the threshold voltage VTH, according to Eq. (1); this may be observed by rearranging Eq. (1) as:\n                              V          S                =                              -                          V              TH                                -                                    (                                                                    I                    D                                                        \u03b2                    \u2062                                                                                  \u2062                                          V                      DS                                                                      +                                                      V                    DS                                    2                                            )                        .                                              (        3        )            \nSince the threshold voltage VTH of the ISFET is sensitive to ion concentration as discussed above, according to Eq. (3) the source voltage VS provides a signal that is directly related to the ion concentration in the analyte solution 74 in proximity to the sensitive area 78 of the ISFET. In exemplary conventional ISFETs employing a silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride passivation layer 72 for pH-sensitivity, a threshold voltage sensitivities \u0394VTH (i.e., a change in threshold voltage with change in pH of the analyte solution) of approximately 30 mV/pH to 50 mV/pH have been observed (with a theoretical maximum sensitivity of 59.2 mV/pH at 298 degrees Kelvin).\nPrior research efforts to fabricate ISFETs for pH measurements based on conventional CMOS processing techniques typically have aimed to achieve high signal linearity over a pH range from 1-14. Using an exemplary threshold sensitivity of approximately 50 mV/pH, and considering Eq. (3) above, this requires a linear operating range of approximately 700 mV for the source voltage VS. As discussed above in connection with FIG. 1, the threshold voltage VTH of ISFETs (as well as MOSFETs) is affected by any voltage VSB between the source and the body (n-type well 54). More specifically, the threshold voltage VTH is a nonlinear function of a nonzero source-to-body voltage VSB. Accordingly, so as to avoid compromising linearity due to a difference between the source and body voltage potentials (i.e., to mitigate the \u201cbody effect\u201d), as shown in FIG. 1 the source 56 and body connection 62 of the ISFET 50 often are coupled to a common potential via the metal contact 68. This body-source coupling also is shown in the electric circuit representation of the ISFET 50 shown in FIG. 2.\nPrevious efforts to fabricate two-dimensional arrays of ISFETs based on the ISFET design of FIG. 1 have resulted in a maximum of 256 ISFET sensor elements, or \u201cpixels,\u201d in an array (i.e., a 16 pixel by 16 pixel array). Exemplary research in ISFET array fabrication are reported in the publications \u201cA large transistor-based sensor array chip for direct extracellular imaging,\u201d M. J. Milgrew, M. O.

The column 85j includes sixteen (16) pixels 801 through 8016 and, as discussed further below in connection with FIG. 7, a complete two-dimensional array includes sixteen (16) such columns 85j (j=1, 2, 3, . . . 16) arranged side by side. As shown in FIG. 3, a given column 85j includes a current source ISOURCEj that is shared by all pixels of the column, and ISFET bias/readout circuitry 82j (including current sink ISINKj) that is also shared by all pixels of the column. Each ISFET pixel 801 through 8016 includes a p-channel ISFET 50 having an electrically coupled source and body (as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2), plus two switches S1 and S2 that are responsive to one of sixteen row select signals (RSEL1 through RSEL16, and their complements). As discussed below in connection with FIG. 7, a row select signal and its complement are generated simultaneously to \u201cenable\u201d or select a given pixel of the column 85j, and such signal pairs are generated in some sequence to successively enable different pixels of the column one at a time.\nAs shown in FIG. 3, the switch S2 of each pixel 80 in the design of Milgrew et al. is implemented as a conventional n-channel MOSFET that couples the current source ISOURCEj to the source of the ISFET 50 upon receipt of the corresponding row select signal. The switch S1 of each pixel 80 is implemented as a transmission gate, i.e., a CMOS pair including an n-channel MOSFET and a p-channel MOSFET, that couples the source of the ISFET 50 to the bias/readout circuitry 82j upon receipt of the corresponding row select signal and its complement. An example of the switch S11 of the pixel 801 is shown in FIG. 4, in which the p-channel MOSFET of the transmission gate is indicated as S11P and the re-channel MOSFET is indicated as S11N. In the design of Milgrew et al., a transmission gate is employed for the switch S1 of each pixel so that, for an enabled pixel, any ISFET source voltage within the power supply range VDD to VSS may be applied to the bias/readout circuitry 82j and output by the column as the signal Vsj. From the foregoing, it should be appreciated that each pixel 80 in the ISFET sensor array design of Milgrew et al. includes four transistors, i.e., a p-channel ISFET, a CMOS-pair transmission gate including an re-channel MOSFET and a p-channel MOSFET for switch S1, and an n-channel MOSFET for switch S2.\nAs also shown in FIG. 3, the bias/readout circuitry 82j employs a source-drain follower configuration in the form of a Kelvin bridge to maintain a constant drain-source voltage VDSj and isolate the measurement of the source voltage Vsj from the constant drain current ISOURCEj for the ISFET of an enabled pixel in the column 85j. To this end, the bias/readout circuitry 82j includes two operational amplifiers A1 and A2, a current sink ISINKj, and a resistor RSDj. The voltage developed across the resistor RSDj due to the current ISINKj flowing through the resistor is forced by the operational amplifiers to appear across the drain and source of the ISFET of an enabled pixel as a constant drain-source voltage VDSj. Thus, with reference again to Eq. (3), due to the constant VDSj and the constant ISOURCEj, the source voltage Vsj of the ISFET of the enabled pixel provides a signal corresponding to the ISFETs threshold voltage VTH, and hence a measurement of pH in proximity to the ISFETs sensitive area (see FIG. 1). The wide dynamic range for the source voltage Vsj provided by the transmission gate S1 ensures that a full range of pH values from 1-14 may be measured, and the source-body connection of each ISFET ensures sufficient linearity of the ISFETs threshold voltage over the full pH measurement range.\nIn the column design of Milgrew et al. shown in FIG. 3, it should be appreciated that for the Kelvin bridge configuration of the column bias/readout circuitry 82j to function properly, a p-channel ISFET 50 as shown in FIG. 1 must be employed in each pixel; more specifically, an alternative implementation based on the Kelvin bridge configuration is not possible using an n-channel ISFET. With reference again to FIG. 1, for an n-channel ISFET based on a conventional CMOS process, the n-type well 54 would not be required, and highly doped n-type regions for the drain and source would be formed directly in the p-type silicon substrate 52 (which would constitute the transistor body). For n-channel FET devices, the transistor body typically is coupled to electrical ground. Given the requirement that the source and body of an ISFET in the design of Milgrew et al. are electrically coupled together to mitigate nonlinear performance due to the body effect, this would result in the source of an n-channel ISFET also being connected to electrical ground (i.e., VS=VB=0 Volts), thereby precluding any useful output signal from an enabled pixel. Accordingly, the column design of Milgrew et al. shown in FIG. 3 requires p-channel ISFETs for proper operation.\nIt should also be appreciated that in the column design of Milgrew et al. shown in FIG. 3, the two n-channel MOSFETs required to implement the switches S1 and S2 in each pixel cannot be formed in the n-type well 54 shown in FIG. 1, in which the p-channel ISFET for the pixel is formed; rather, the n-channel MOSFETs are formed directly in the p-type silicon substrate 52, beyond the confines of the n-type well 54 for the ISFET. FIG. 5 is a diagram similar to FIG. 1, illustrating a wider cross-section of a portion of the p-type silicon substrate 52 corresponding to one pixel 80 of the column 85j shown in FIG. 3, in which the n-type well 54 containing the drain 58, source 56 and body connection 62 of the ISFET 50 is shown alongside a first n-channel MOSFET corresponding to the switch S2 and a second n-channel MOSFET S1IN constituting one of the two transistors of the transmission gate S11 shown in FIG. 4.\nFurthermore, in the design of Milgrew et al., the p-channel MOSFET required to implement the transmission gate S1 in each pixel (e.g., see S11P in FIG. 4) cannot be formed in the same n-type well in which the p-channel ISFET 50 for the pixel is formed. In particular, because the body and source of the p-channel ISFET are electrically coupled together, implementing the p-channel MOSFET S11P in the same n-well as the p-channel ISFET 50 would lead to unpredictable operation of the transmission gate, or preclude operation entirely. Accordingly, two separate n-type wells are required to implement each pixel in the design of Milgrew et al. FIG. 6 is a diagram similar to FIG. 5, showing a cross-section of another portion of the p-type silicon substrate 52 corresponding to one pixel 80, in which the n-type well 54 corresponding to the ISFET 50 is shown alongside a second n-type well 55 in which is formed the p-channel MOSFET S11P constituting one of the two transistors of the transmission gate S11 shown in FIG. 4. It should be appreciated that the drawings in FIGS. 5 and 6 are not to scale and may not exactly represent the actual layout of a particular pixel in the design of Milgrew et al.; rather these figures are conceptual in nature and are provided primarily to illustrate the requirements of multiple n-wells, and separate n-channel MOSFETs fabricated outside of the n-wells, in the design of Milgrew et al.\nThe array design of Milgrew et al. was implemented using a 0.35 micrometer (\u03bcm) conventional CMOS fabrication process. In this process, various design rules dictate minimum separation distances between features. For example, according to the 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS design rules, with reference to FIG. 6, a distance \u201ca\u201d between neighboring n-wells must be at least three (3) micrometers. A distance \u201ca/2\u201d also is indicated in FIG. 6 to the left of the n-well 54 and to the right of the n-well 55 to indicate the minimum distance required to separate the pixel 80 shown in FIG. 6 from neighboring pixels in other columns to the left and right, respectively. Additionally, according to the 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS design rules, a distance \u201cb\u201d shown in FIG. 6 representing the width in cross-section of the n-type well 54 and a distance \u201cc\u201d representing the width in cross-section of the n-type well 55 are each on the order of approximately 3 \u03bcm to 4 \u03bcm (within the n-type well, an allowance of 1.2 \u03bcm is made between the edge of the n-well and each of the source and drain, and the source and drain themselves have a width on the order of 0.7 \u03bcm). Accordingly, a total distance \u201cd\u201d shown in FIG. 6 representing the width of the pixel 80 in cross-section is on the order of approximately 12 \u03bcm to 14 \u03bcm. In one implementation, Milgrew et al. report an array based on the column/pixel design shown in FIG. 3 comprising geometrically square pixels each having a dimension of 12.8 \u03bcm by 12.8 \u03bcm.\nIn sum, the ISFET pixel design of Milgrew et al. is aimed at ensuring accurate hydrogen ion concentration measurements over a pH range of 1-14. To ensure measurement linearity, the source and body of each pixel's ISFET are electrically coupled together. To ensure a full range of pH measurements, a transmission gate S1 is employed in each pixel to transmit the source voltage of an enabled pixel. Thus, each pixel of Milgrew's array requires four transistors (p-channel ISFET, p-channel MOSFET, and two n-channel MOSFETs) and two separate n-wells (FIG. 6). Based on a 0.35 micrometer conventional CMOS fabrication process and the corresponding design rules, the pixels of such an array have a minimum size appreciably greater than 10 \u03bcm, i.e., on the order of approximately 12 \u03bcm to 14 \u03bcm.\nFIG. 7 illustrates a complete two-dimensional pixel array 95 according to the design of Milgrew et al., together with accompanying row and column decoder circuitry and measurement readout circuitry. The array 95 includes sixteen columns 851 through 8516 of pixels, each column having sixteen pixels as discussed above in connection with FIG. 3 (i.e., a 16 pixel by 16 pixel array). A row decoder 92 provides sixteen pairs of complementary row select signals, wherein each pair of row select signals simultaneously enables one pixel in each column 851 through 8516 to provide a set of column output signals from the array 95 based on the respective source voltages VS1 through VS16 of the enabled row of ISFETs. The row decoder 92 is implemented as a conventional four-to-sixteen decoder (i.e., a four-bit binary input ROW1-ROW4 to select one of 24 outputs). The set of column output signals VS1 through VS16 for an enabled row of the array is applied to switching logic 96, which includes sixteen transmission gates S1 through S16 (one transmission gate for each output signal). As above, each transmission gate of the switching logic 96 is implemented using a p-channel MOSFET and an n-channel MOSFET to ensure a sufficient dynamic range for each of the output signals VS1 through VS16. The column decoder 94, like the row decoder 92, is implemented as a conventional four-to-sixteen decoder and is controlled via the four-bit binary input COL1-COL4 to enable one of the transmission gates S1 through S16 of the switching logic 96 at any given time, so as to provide a single output signal VS from the switching logic 96. This output signal VS is applied to a 10-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) 98 to provide a digital representation D1-D10 of the output signal VS corresponding to a given pixel of the array.\nAs noted earlier, individual ISFETs and arrays of ISFETs similar to those discussed above have been employed as sensing devices in a variety of applications involving chemistry and biology. In particular, ISFETs have been employed as pH sensors in various processes involving nucleic acids such as DNA.

The term \u201csequencing\u201d refers to the determination of a primary structure (or primary sequence) of an unbranched biopolymer, which results in a symbolic linear depiction known as a \u201csequence\u201d that succinctly summarizes much of the atomic-level structure of the sequenced molecule. \u201cDNA sequencing\u201d particularly refers to the process of determining the nucleotide order of a given DNA fragment. Analysis of entire genomes of viruses, bacteria, fungi, animals and plants is now possible, but such analysis generally is limited due to the cost and throughput of sequencing. More specifically, present conventional sequencing methods are limited in terms of the accuracy of the sequence, the length of individual templates that can be sequenced, the cost of the sequence, and the rate of sequence determination.\nDespite improvements in sample preparation and sequencing technologies, none of the present conventional sequencing strategies, including those to date that may involve ISFETs, has provided the cost reductions required to increase throughput to levels required for analysis of large numbers of individual human genomes. It is necessary to sequence a large number of individual genomes to understand the genetic basis of disease and aging. In addition, a large number of cancers will need to be sequenced to understand the somatic changes underlying cancer. Some recent efforts have made significant gains in both the ability to prepare genomes for sequencing and to sequence large numbers of templates simultaneously. However, these and other efforts are still limited by the relatively large size of the reaction volumes needed to prepare templates that are detectable by these systems, as well as the need for special nucleotide analogues, and complex enzymatic or fluorescent methods to read out the bases.",

At the beginning, there is a beautiful harmonic stack with 10 or more harmonics! These quickly fade away and are not even visible after 5 seconds. If you are trying to estimate the pitch of the entire signal, your estimate might be contaminated by the \"pitch\" of the sound from 5-12 seconds. Try computing the pitch only for the first 1-2 seconds.\nThere is too much low frequency noise. In the spectrogram, you can see a lot of  power between 0 and 64 Hz. This is not part of the harmonics, so you could try removing it with a high-pass filter.\nHere is some code that does the job:\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.io import wavfile\nfrom scipy import signal\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom frequency_estimator import freq_from_hps\n# downloaded from https://github.com/endolith/waveform-analyzer/\n\nfilename = 'Vocaroo_s1KZzNZLtg3c.wav'\n# downloaded from http://vocaroo.com/i/s1KZzNZLtg3c\n\n# Parameters\ntime_start = 0  # seconds\ntime_end = 1  # seconds\nfilter_stop_freq = 70  # Hz\nfilter_pass_freq = 100  # Hz\nfilter_order = 1001\n\n# Load data\nfs, audio = wavfile.read(filename)\naudio = audio.astype(float)\n\n# High-pass filter\nnyquist_rate = fs / 2.\ndesired = (0, 0, 1, 1)\nbands = (0, filter_stop_freq, filter_pass_freq, nyquist_rate)\nfilter_coefs = signal.firls(filter_order, bands, desired, nyq=nyquist_rate)\n\n# Examine our high pass filter\nw, h = signal.freqz(filter_coefs)\nf = w / 2 / np.pi * fs  # convert radians/sample to cycles/second\nplt.plot(f, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)), 'b')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]', color='b')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')\nplt.xlim((0, 300))\n\n# Apply high-pass filter\nfiltered_audio = signal.filtfilt(filter_coefs, [1], audio)\n\n# Only analyze the audio between time_start and time_end\ntime_seconds = np.arange(filtered_audio.size, dtype=float) / fs\naudio_to_analyze = filtered_audio[(time_seconds >= time_start) &\n                                  (time_seconds <= time_end)]\n\nfundamental_frequency = freq_from_hps(audio_to_analyze, fs)\nprint 'Fundamental frequency is {} Hz'.format(fundamental_frequency)\n\n",
    "ism.) A matroid $M$ is *round* if $E(M)$ is not the union of two hyperplanes, or equivalently if $M$ is infinitely vertically connected. Our main theorem is the following:\n\n\\[main\\] Let $q$ be a prime power and $M$ be a round rank-$r$ matroid with a $\\operatorname{PG}(12q^{12}+19,q)$-minor. The following are equivalent:\n\n1.  \\[mainone\\] $M$ is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular;\n\n2.  \\[maintwo\\] $M$ is representable over $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$ and $\\operatorname{GF}(q^{t})$ for some odd integer $t \\ge 3$; and\n\n3.  \\[mainthree\\] $\\operatorname{si}(M)$ is a restriction of either ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(r-1,q)$ or ${{{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}}(r-1,q)$.\n\nThis exactly characterises all $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular matroids that are sufficiently \u2018rich\u2019 and highly connected; the equivalence of (\\[mainone\\]) and (\\[maintwo\\]) is strongly reminiscent of Tutte\u2019s characterisation of regular matroids of the usual sort, and motivates our use of the word. This equivalence may hold for all matroids (this has essentially been conjectured for $q = 2$ in \\[\\[pvz\\], Conjecture 6.8\\]), but the characterisation in (\\[mainthree\\]) requires some extra hypotheses, and we briefly discuss the ones we chose.\n\nAs one could otherwise construct counterexamples by taking $2$-sums and $3$-sums, some connectivity assumption is needed. However, the hypothesis of roundness is probably overkill. The theorem likely holds for vertically $4$-connected matroids, and many of our techniques apply in this more general setting. Proving a \u2018vertically $4$-connected\u2019 version of the theorem would require analysis of how the structure in (\\[mainthree\\]) propagates over $4$-separations.\n\nThe hypothesis of having some sort of underlying \u2018richness\u2019, here a large projective geometry minor, is also necessary; the structure in (\\[mainthree\\]) does not describe all vertically $4$-connected $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular matroids. Indeed, Gerards \\[\\[gthesis\\]\\] defined a class of signed-graphic matroids representable over every field with at least three elements; this class contains counterexamples to our theorem of arbitrarily high branch-width. However, Gerards\u2019 counterexamples are nearly planar; it is possible that a very similar structure to that in (\\[mainthree\\]) holds for all vertically $4$-connected matroids with a large enough clique minor. Round $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-representable matroids of huge rank have a large clique minor \\[\\[ggwep\\]\\], so in the round setting it is possible that our hypothesis of a large projective geometry minor could be replaced with a \u2018large rank\u2019 hypothesis with few other changes to the theorem statement.\n\nThough the material in this paper is self-contained, sections\u00a0\\[tanglesec1\\] and\u00a0\\[tanglesec2\\] make essential use of the theory of tangles and some currently unpublished techniques due to Geelen, Gerards and Whittle \\[\\[ggwnonprime\\]\\].\n\nPreliminaries\n=============\n\nWe largely follow the notation of Oxley \\[\\[oxley\\]\\]. We also write ${\\epsilon}(M)$ for $|\\operatorname{si}(M)|$. For a positive integer $n$, we denote the set $\\{1, \\dotsc, n\\}$ by $[n]$. Finally, if ${\\mathbb F}_0$ is a subfield of a field ${\\mathbb F}$ and $A$ is an ${\\mathbb F}$ matrix, we write $\\operatorname{row}_{{\\mathbb F}_0}(A)$ for the vector space containing all linear combinations of the rows of $A$ with coefficients in ${\\mathbb F}_0$. We define $\\operatorname{col}_{{\\mathbb F}_0}(A)$ similarly.\n\nThe versions of connectivity we consider are all \u2018vertical\u2019; for $k \\in {\\mathbb Z}^+ \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ a set $A \\subseteq E(M)$ is $\\emph{vertically $k$-separating}$ in $M$ if $\\lambda_M(A) < k$ and $\\min(r_M(A), r(M {\\setminus \\!}A)) \\ge k$, and $M$ is $\\emph{vertically $k$-connected}$ if $M$ has no vertically $k'$-separating subsets for any $k' \\le k$. $M$ is *round* if it is vertically $\\infty$-connected; for example cliques, projective geometries and non-binary affine geometries are round. A matroid $M$ is vertically $k$-connected if and only if its simplification is vertically $k$-connected. Moreover if $M$ is vertically $k$-connected then $M {/}e$ is vertically $(k-1)$-connected for each $e \\in E(M)$; in particular if $M$ is round then so is $M {/}e$. We will use the following slight strengthening of a well-known result on connectivity; see \\[\\[oxley\\], Theorem 8.5.7\\].\n\n\\[linking\\] Let $M$ be a matroid and $A,B \\subseteq E(M)$ be disjoint sets. There is a minor $N$ of $M$ so that $E(N) = A \\cup B$, $N|A = M|A$, $N|B = M|B$ and $\\lambda_N(A) = \\kappa_M(A,B)$.\n\nTo avoid complications arising from inequivalent representations, we will often consider matroids defined by a representation rather than axiomatically. If ${\\mathbb F}$ is a field, then an *${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroid* on ground set $E$ is a pair $M = (U,E)$, where $U$ is a subspace of ${\\mathbb F}^E$. This represented matroid has rank function given by $r_M(X) = \\dim(U[X])$ for each $X \\subseteq E$, where $U[X]$ is the projection of $U$ onto ${\\mathbb F}^{X}$. Where confusion might arise, we refer to a matroid defined in the usual way as an *abstract* matroid; if $M$ is an ${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroid then we write $\\tilde{M}$ for the abstract matroid with the same rank function as $M$.\n\nGiven a matrix $A \\in {\\mathbb F}^{X \\times E}$, we write $M(A)$ for the ${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroid $(\\operatorname{row}(A),E)$ and $\\tilde{M}(A)$ for the associated abstract matroid; here $A$ is an *${\\mathbb F}$-representation* of $M(A)$. We also need to formalize deletion and contraction in this context; given an ${\\mathbb F}$-representation $A$ of an ${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroid $M$ and a set $X \\subseteq E(M)$, we write $M {\\setminus \\!}X$ for the ${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroid $M(A[E(M)-X])$. It is easiest to define contraction in terms of duality; if $M = (U,E)$ is an ${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroid then let $M^* = (U^{\\perp},E)$, where $U^\\perp = \\{v \\in {\\mathbb F}^E: \\langle v,u \\rangle = 0 \\text{ for all $u \\in U$}\\}$, and $M {/}X = (M^* {\\setminus \\!}X)^*$. Given a particular representation $A$, this is equivalent to the usual matrix interpretation of contraction where we row-reduce and take a submatrix of $A$. We extend these definitions to define a *minor* and *restriction* of an ${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroid, as well as extending all other usual matroidal notions such as connectivity.\n\nIf ${\\mathbb F}_0$ is a subfield of ${\\mathbb F}$, then two ${\\mathbb F}$-matrices $A_1,A_2$ are *${\\mathbb F}_0$-row-equivalent* if one can be obtained from the other by elementary row-operations only involving coefficients in ${\\mathbb F}_0$. Furthermore, the matrices $A_1,A_2$ are *${\\mathbb F}_0$-projectively equivalent* if there is a matrix $A_1'$ that is ${\\mathbb F}_0$-row-equivalent to $A_1$ that can be obtained from $A_2$ by scaling columns by nonzero elements of ${\\mathbb F}_0$. We also say that the ${\\mathbb F}$-represented matroids $M(A_1)$ and $M(A_2)$ are ${\\mathbb F}_0$-projectively equivalent. If ${\\mathbb F}_0 = {\\mathbb F}$ then we just say the matrices or represented matroids are *projectively equivalent*, and write $A_1  \\approx A_2$ and $M(A_1) \\approx M(A_2)$. It is clear that if $M \\approx M'$ then $\\tilde{M} = \\tilde{M'}$. For each integer $n$, let ${\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(n-1,q)$ denote the set of $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-matrices $G$ with row-set $[n]$ satisfying $\\tilde{M}(G) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$.\n\nAlgebra\n=======\n\nWe frequently consider an extension field ${\\mathbb F}$ of a field ${\\mathbb F}_0$; our main theorem applies just when ${\\mathbb F}_0 = \\operatorname{GF}(q)$ and ${\\mathbb F}= \\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$, but some lemmas apply for arbitrary ${\\mathbb F}_0$. When the extension has degree $2$ with ${\\mathbb F}= {\\mathbb F}_0(\\omega)$, we often use the fact that ${\\mathbb F}$ is a dimension-$2$ vector space over ${\\mathbb F}_0$ with basis $\\{1,\\omega\\}$. We require a few lemmas relating ${\\mathbb F}_0$ and ${\\mathbb F}$ in various contexts; the first is proved in \\[\\[n13\\]\\].\n\n\\[confinement\\] Let $n \\ge 3$ be an integer, $q$ be a prime power, and ${\\mathbb F}$ be a field with a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-subfield. If $A$ is an ${\\mathbb F}$-matrix with $M(A) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$, then $A$ is projectively equivalent to a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-matrix.\n\nWe will apply the next lemma in the case where $j = 2$ and $h = 3$.\n\n\\[gfqvectorinplane\\] Let ${\\mathbb F}= {\\mathbb F}_0(\\omega)$ be a degree-$2$ extension field of a field ${\\mathbb F}_0$ and let $j,h,t \\in {\\mathbb Z}^+$ satisfy $2j > h$ and $j,h \\le t$. If $V$ is an $h$-dimensional subspace of ${\\mathbb F}_0^t$ and $U$ is a $j$-dimensional subspace of ${\\mathbb F}^t$ such that $U \\subseteq \\operatorname{span}_{{\\mathbb F}}(V)$, then $U \\cap V$ is nontrivial.\n\nLet $\\{b_1, \\dotsc, b_h\\}$ be a basis for $V$ and let $W = \\operatorname{span}_{{\\mathbb F}}(V)$, noting that each $w \\in W$ is expressible in the form $\\sum_{i=1}^h(\\lambda_i + \\omega \\mu_i)b_i$ for some unique $\\lambda,\\mu \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^h$. Let $\\varphi: W \\to {\\mathbb F}_0^{2h}$ be the invertible linear transformation defined by $\\varphi\\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^h(\\lambda_i + \\omega \\mu_i)b_i\\right) = (\\lambda_1, \\dotsc, \\lambda_h, \\mu_1, \\dotsc, \\mu_h)$. Now $\\varphi(U)$ and $\\varphi(V)$ are subspaces of ${\\mathbb F}_0^{2h}$ with $\\dim(\\varphi(U)) = 2j$ and $\\dim(\\varphi(V)) = h$, so $\\dim(\\varphi(U) \\cap \\varphi(V)) = 2j + h - 2h > 0$. Therefore $U \\cap V$ is nontrivial, as required.\n\n\\[sunday0\\] Let ${\\mathbb F}_0$ be a field and ${\\mathbb F}= {\\mathbb F}_0(\\omega)$ be a degree-$2$ extension field of ${\\mathbb F}_0$. Let $h,d,n \\in {\\mathbb Z}_0^+$ satisfy $h \\le d$ and let $A,B \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{d \\times n}$ be matrices such that $\\operatorname{rank}(A + \\omega B) = d$. If $\\operatorname{rank}\\binom{A}{B} = 2d - h$ then there is a rank-$h$ matrix $Q \\in {\\mathbb F}^{h \\times d}$ such that $Q(A + \\omega B)$ is an ${\\mathbb F}_0$-matrix.\n\nLet $\\omega^2 = s + \\omega t$ for $s,t \\in {\\mathbb F}_0$. If $\\operatorname{rank}\\binom{A}{B} = 2d - h$ then there are matrices $Q_1,Q_2 \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{h \\times d}$ such that $(Q_1 | Q_2)\\binom{A}{B} = Q_1 A + Q_2 B = 0$ and $\\operatorname{rank}(Q_1 | Q_2) = h$. Let $Q = (\\omega - t)Q_1 + Q_2$; we have $Q(A + \\omega B) = (Q_2A - tQ_1A + sQ_1B) + \\omega(Q_1 A + Q_2B)$ which is an ${\\mathbb F}_0$-matrix.\n\nIt remains to show that $\\operatorname{rank}(Q) = h$. If not, then there are row vectors $x,y \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^h$ such that $x + \\omega y \\ne 0$ and $(x + \\omega y)Q = 0$. This gives $(xQ_2 - txQ_1 + syQ_1) + \\omega(xQ_1 + yQ_2) = 0$, implying that $$\\label{sunday1}\n        {\\left(\\begin{matrix}-t & s \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{matrix}\\right)} \\binom{x}{y} Q_1 + \\binom{x}{y}Q_2 = 0.$$ Note that the matrix $J = {\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}1 & t \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)}$ satisfies ${\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & s \\\\ 1 & t\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)}J = J{\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}t & -s \\\\ -1 & 0\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)}$. Set $\\binom{u}{v} = J\\binom{x}{y}Q_1$; we will argue that $u + \\omega v \\ne 0$ and $(u + \\omega v)(A + \\omega B) = 0$, which contradicts $\\operatorname{rank}(A+\\omega B) = d$. If $u + \\omega v = 0$, then $\\binom{u}{v} = 0$ and, since $J$ is nonsingular, $\\binom{x}{y}Q_1 = 0$. This implies $xQ_1 = yQ_1 = 0$, which together with (\\[sunday1\\]) and the fact that $\\operatorname{rank}(Q_1 | Q_2) = h$ yields $\\binom{x}{y} = 0$, which is not the case. Therefore $\\binom{u}{v} \\ne 0$. We have $(u+ \\omega v)(A + \\omega B) = (uA + svB) + \\omega(uB + vA + tvB) = \\left\\langle\\binom{1}{\\omega},\\binom{u}{v}A + {\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & s \\\\ 1 & t\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)}\\binom{u}{v}B\\right\\rangle.$ Now $$\\begin{aligned}\n        \\binom{u}{v}A + {\\left(\\begin{matrix}0 & s \\\\ 1 & t\\end{matrix}\\right)}\\binom{u}{v}B &= J\\binom{x}{y}Q_1 A + {\\left(\\begin{matrix}0 & s \\\\ 1 & t\\end{matrix}\\right)}J\\binom{x}{y}Q_1B \\\\ \n        &= J\\left(\\binom{x}{y}Q_1A + {\\left(\\begin{matrix}t & -s \\\\ -1 & 0\\end{matrix}\\right)}\\binom{x}{y}Q_1B\\right) \\\\\n        &= -J\\left(\\binom{x}{y}Q_2 + {\\left(\\begin{matrix}-t & s \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{matrix}\\right)}\\binom{x}{y}Q_1\\right)B,\n    \\end{aligned}$$ since $Q_1A = -Q_2B$. Now combining the above with (\\[sunday1\\]) we see that $(u + \\omega v)(A + \\omega B) = 0$, contradicting the fact that $\\operatorname{rank}(A + \\omega B) = d$ and $u + \\omega v \\ne 0$.\n\nThe above lemma has the following as a straightforward corollary.\n\n\\[sunday\\] Let ${\\mathbb F}= {\\mathbb F}_0(\\omega)$ be a degree-$2$ extension field of a field ${\\mathbb F}_0$. Let $h,d,m,n \\in {\\mathbb Z}_0^+$ satisfy $0 \\le h \\le d \\le n$ and $A,B \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{d \\times n}$ and $P \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{m \\times n}$ be such that $\\operatorname{rank}\\binom{A+ \\omega B}{P} = m+d$, $\\operatorname{rank}(P) = m$ and $\\operatorname{rank}\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}A \\\\ B \\\\ P \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) \\le m+2d-h$. There exist matrices $A',B' \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{d \\times n}$ such that $\\binom{A + \\omega B}{P}$ and $\\binom{A' + \\omega B'}{P}$ are row-equivalent and $B'$ has $h$ zero rows.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nWe now investigate the two classes of $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular matroids from our main theorem. We define them differently from in the introduction in order to prove that they are both well-defined and $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular. We will use the fact that projective geometries are *modular*; that is, that every pair of flats $F_1,F_2$ satisfies $r(F_1 \\cap F_2) = r(F_1) + r(F_2) - r(F_1 \\cup F_2)$.\n\nLet ${\\mathbb F}$ be a field with a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-subfield, $n \\ge 3$ be an integer, $A \\in {\\mathcal{P}}{\\mathcal{G}}(n-1,q)$ and $N = \\tilde{M}(A) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$. Let $L_0$ be a line of $N$ and $v \\in \\operatorname{col}_{{\\mathbb F}}(A[L_0])$ be not parallel to any column of $A[L_0]$. Let $f \\in E(N)-L_0$ and ${\\mathcal{L}}$ be the collection of lines of $\\operatorname{cl}_N(L_0 \\cup \\{f\\})$ not containing $f$, noting that $|{\\mathcal{L}}| = q^2$. For each $L \\in {\\mathcal{L}}$, let $v_L$ be a nonzero vector in the rank-$1$ subspace $\\operatorname{col}_{\\mathbb F}(A_L) \\cap \\operatorname{col}_{{\\mathbb F}}(v | A[f])$. Let $X = \\{x_L : L \\in {\\mathcal{L}}\\}$ be a $q^2$-element set and let $\\overline{A} \\in {\\mathbb F}^{[n] \\times (E(N) \\cup X)}$ be the matrix so that $\\overline{A}[E(N)] = A$ and $\\overline{A}[x_L] = v_L$ for each $L \\in {\\mathcal{L}}$.\n\nThe matroid $\\tilde{M}(\\overline{A})$ is determined up to isomorphism by the choice of $n$ and $q$.\n\nLet $M = \\tilde{M}({\\overline}{A})$. We have $M {\\setminus \\!}X = N \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$. Let ${\\mathcal{F}}_N$ be the set of cyclic flats of $N$ and ${\\mathcal{F}}_M$ be that of $M$. Let $P = \\operatorname{cl}_N(L_0 \\cup \\{f\\})$. Note that every pair of lines of $P$ intersect. It is easy to check the following claim:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n            {\\mathcal{F}}_M = \\ \\  & \\{F: F \\in {\\mathcal{F}}_N, |F \\cap P| \\le 1\\} \\\\\n             \\cup & \\{F \\cup X:  F \\in {\\mathcal{F}}_N, F \\cap P = \\{f\\}\\} \\\\\n             \\cup & \\{F \\cup \\{x_{L}\\}: F \\in {\\mathcal{F}}_N, F \\cap P = L \\in {\\mathcal{L}}\\} \\\\\n             \\cup & \\{F : F \\in {\\mathcal{F}}_N, r_M(F \\cap P) = 2, F \\cap P \\notin {\\mathcal{L}}\\} \\\\\n             \\cup & \\{F \\cup X: F \\in {\\mathcal{F}}_N, P \\subseteq F\\}  .\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince a matroid is determined by its collection of cyclic flats, the matroid $\\tilde{M}({\\overline}{A})$ is therefore determined, for a given $n$ and $q$, by the naming of elements in $X$ and the choice of $N,P$ and $f$. There is only one choice for $N$ up to isomorphism, and the lemma now follows from the fact that the $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q))$ acts transitively on pairs $(P,f)$, where $P$ is a plane containing $f$.\n\nWe write ${{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ for any matroid isomorphic to $M(\\overline{A})$. Note that $M = {{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ arises from $N = \\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$ by adding $q^2$ new points on a line, spanned by a plane $P$ of $M$ and spanning a single point of $P$. The following is immediate from the definition and the previous lemma.\n\n\\[lregular\\] The matroid ${{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular.\n\nWe now turn to our second class, which is simpler to analyse. Let ${\\mathbb F}$ be a field with a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-subfield and let $n \\ge 2$. Let $B \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(n,q)$ and $N = \\tilde{M}(B)$. Let $L_0$ be a line of $N$ and $v \\in \\operatorname{col}_{{\\mathbb F}}(B[L_0])$ be a nonzero vector, not parallel to any column of $B[L_0]$. Let $e \\notin E(N)$ and $B^+ \\in {\\mathbb F}^{[n+1] \\times (E(N) \\cup \\{e\\})}$ be such that $B^+[E(N)] = B$ and $B^+[e] = v$.\n\nBy modularity of $N$, the matroid $\\tilde{M}(B^+)$ is isomorphic to the principal extension of $L_0$ in $N$ by the element $e$, and is therefore determined up to isomorphism by $n$ and $q$ (due to transitivity of $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\operatorname{PG}(n,q))$ on its set of lines). We write ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ for any matroid isomorphic to the rank-$n$ matroid $\\operatorname{si}(\\tilde{M}(B^+) {/}e)$. The following is clear by construction:\n\n\\[hregular\\] The matroid ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular.\n\nWhile we have specified these matroids abstractly to emphasise their $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regularity and the fact that they are well-defined, we will only be interested in their $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-representations. We first consider ${{{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}}(n-1,q)$. The line $X$ we add is a $U_{2,q^2+1}$-restriction spanned by an element $f$ of $N$, together with an element $x_{L_0}$ that is spanned by $L_0$ but not contained in $L_0$. Since there are at most $q^2+1$ points on every line in $\\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q^2)$, there is only one way to add the points in $X$ given a choice of $f$ and $x_{L_0}$. By choosing a basis for $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)^n$ in which $L_0$ and $f$ correspond to the first three standard basis vectors, we see that ${{{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}}(n-1,q)$ has the following as a representation: $$\\begin{aligned}\n {\\overline}{A}(n-1,q) = \\kbordermatrix{\n    & x_{L_0} & X - \\{x_{L_0}\\} & E(N) \\\\\n    &   1     &     \\alpha        &     \\          \\\\\n    &  \\omega &         \\omega \\alpha         &        \\             \\\\\n    &   0     &      1         &     A          \\\\\n    &   0     &     0         &    \\           \\\\\n    &   \\vdots     &     \\vdots  & & \\  \\\\\n    },\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\alpha$ ranges over $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)-\\{0\\}$, and $A \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(n-1,q)$ is such that $A_f$ is the third standard basis vector. Now we consider ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$. Let $B \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(n,q)$ be a matrix containing among its columns the standard basis vectors $b_1, \\dotsc, b_{n+1} \\in \\operatorname{GF}(q)^{n+1}$. If we choose $L_0$ to be the line spanned by $b_1$ and $b_2$ and $v$ to be the vector $b_1 - \\omega b_2$, the matroid ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$, obtained by appending $v$ to $B$ and contracting the corresponding element, has the following representation: $$\\widehat{A}(n-1,q) = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccccc}  \n     (0 + 0\\omega)\\mathbf{j} & (1 + 0\\omega) \\mathbf{j} & \\dotsc & (s+t \\omega)\\mathbf{j} & \\dotsc \\\\\n        A     &    A    & \\dotsc &      A    & \\dotsc    \\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right),$$ where $A \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(n-2,q)$, $\\mathbf{j} = (1, \\dotsc, 1)$ denotes the all-ones vector with $\\frac{q^{n-1}-1}{q-1}$ entries, and $s$ and $t$ range over $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$. Note that every vector in $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)^n$ with all but the first entry in $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$ is parallel to a column of ${\\widehat A}(n-1,q)$.\n\nWe have defined ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ and ${{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ abstractly, not as $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-represented matroids. When we refer to the associated $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-represented matroids we will write $M({\\widehat A}(n-1,q))$ and $M({{\\overline}A}(n-1,q))$.\n\nNon-examples {#nonexamples}\n============\n\nLet ${\\mathbb F}= {\\mathbb F}_0(\\omega)$ be a degree-$2$ extension field of a field ${\\mathbb F}_0$. For a vector $w \\in {\\mathbb F}^t$, we write $L(w)$ for the subspace $\\operatorname{span}_{{\\mathbb F}_0}(\\{u,v\\})$, where $u$ and $v$ are the unique ${\\mathbb F}_0$-vectors so that $w = u + \\omega v$. Note that $L(w)$ has dimension $2$ if and only if $w$ is not parallel to an ${\\mathbb F}_0$-vector.\n\nWe now define an important class of rank-$3$ represented matroids that will serve as obstructions to $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-regularity. Let ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$ denote the set of $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-represented matroids $M$ such that $M \\approx M(A \\ |\\ G_3)$, where the column set $X$ of $A$ has three elements, $G_3 \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(2,q)$, and $A \\in \\operatorname{GF}(q^2)^{[3] \\times X}$ is a rank-$3$ matrix such that the three subspaces $L(A_x): x \\in X$ each have dimension $2$ and together have trivial intersection.\n\nMore geometrically, if $M \\in {\\mathcal{O}}(q)$ then $\\tilde{M}$ is obtained by extending a projective plane $R$ over $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$ by a three-element independent set $X$ so that $\\tilde{M}$ is $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-representable and there is no point of $R$ common to the three lines of $R$ spanning the three points of $X$.\n\n\\[obad\\] If $M \\in {\\mathcal{O}}(q)$, then $\\tilde{M}$ is representable over a field ${\\mathbb F}$ if and only if ${\\mathbb F}$ has $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$ as a subfield.\n\nLet $M \\in {\\mathcal{O}}(q)$ and $X,A,G_3$ be defined as above. Let $X = \\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}$ and $R = M {\\setminus \\!}X$, noting that $\\tilde{R} \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(2,q)$. Each pair of subspaces in $\\{L(A_x): x\\in X\\}$ meet in dimension $1$; let $e_i$ be the unique element of $E(R)$ so that $G_3[e_i] \\in \\cap_{j \\in [3]-\\{i\\}}(L(x_j))$. Moreover by Lemma\u00a0\\[gfqvectorinplane\\] each pair of columns of $A$ spans a nonzero $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-vector; for each $i \\in [3]$ let $f_i$ be the unique element of $E(R)$ so that $G_3[f_i] \\in \\operatorname{col}(A[X-\\{x_i\\}])$. Note that $\\tilde{M}$ is a simple rank-$3$ matroid, that $\\tilde{R} \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(2,q)$, and that the subspaces $L(A_x): x \\in X$ correspond to three lines $L_1,L_2,L_3$ of $\\tilde{R}$ so that $x_i \\in \\operatorname{cl}_{\\tilde{M}}(L_i)$ and $L_1 \\cap L_2 \\cap L_3 = \\varnothing$. Further observe that if $i,j \\in [3]$ and $i \\ne j$, then $f_i \\notin L_j$. Since $\\tilde{M}$ is $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-representable it is also representable over all fields with a $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-subfield, so it remains to show that $\\tilde M$ is not representable over any other fields.\n\nLet ${\\mathbb F}$ be a field over which $\\tilde{M}$ is representable and assume for a contradiction that ${\\mathbb F}$ does not have a $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-subfield. Since $\\tilde{R}$ is a minor of $\\tilde{M}$ it follows that ${\\mathbb F}$ has $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$ as a subfield. Let $P \\in {\\mathbb F}^{[3] \\times E(M)}$ be a ${\\mathbb F}$-representation of $\\tilde{M}$; by Lemma\u00a0\\[confinement\\] we may assume that $P[E(R)]$ is a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-matrix and by applying further $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row operations and $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-column scalings we may assume (using the fact that $f_i \\notin L_j$ for $i \\ne j$) that $P$ has the form $$\\begin{aligned}\n P = \\kbordermatrix{\n    & e_1 & e_2 & e_3 & x_1       & x_2     & x_3       & f_1 & f_2 & f_3  &  & \\\\\n    & 1   & 0   & 0   &  0        & \\alpha_2 & \\alpha_3 & s_1 & 1   & 1    & \\ & \\\\\n    & 0   & 1   & 0   &  1        & 0        & 1        & 1   & s_2 & s_4  & \\dotsc & \\\\\n    & 0   & 0   & 1   &  \\alpha_1 & 1        & 0        & 1   & s_3 & s_5  & \\ & \\\\\n    },\n    \\end{aligned}$$ where $\\alpha_i \\in {\\mathbb F}- \\operatorname{GF}(q)$ for each $i \\in [3]$, $s_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $s_j \\in \\operatorname{GF}(q)$ for each $j \\in [5]$. Since $r_{\\tilde{M}}(x_2,x_3,f_1) = 2$, we have $\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 = s_1$. The lines $\\operatorname{cl}_{\\tilde{M}}(\\{f_2,x_3\\})$ and $\\operatorname{cl}_{\\tilde{M}}(\\{x_3,f_2\\})$ both intersect $L_2$ at $x_1$, so the vectors $(0,1-\\alpha_3 s_2,-\\alpha_3s_3)$ and $(0,-\\alpha_2s_4,1-\\alpha_2s_5)$ are both parallel to $(0,1,\\alpha_1)$ and thus $\\alpha_3s_3\\alpha_2s_4 = (1-\\alpha_3s_2)(1-\\alpha_2s_5)$. Using $\\alpha_3 = s_1 -\\alpha_2$, we see that $\\alpha_2$ is a zero of the function $$p(z) = s_3s_4z(s_1-z) - (1-s_2(s_1-z))(1-s_5z).$$ Now $p(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$ with coefficients in $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$ and degree at most $2$. However, $\\alpha_2 \\notin \\operatorname{GF}(q)$ and, since ${\\mathbb F}$ has no $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-subfield, $\\alpha_2$ is not a zero of an irreducible quadratic over $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$. Therefore $p(z)$ is identically zero. We have $0 = p(0) = 1-s_1s_2$, so $s_1s_2 = 1$; since $s_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ this gives $s_1 = s_2 = 1$. Similarly we have $0 = p(s_1) = s_5 - 1$, so $s_5 = 1$. Therefore $p(z) = z(1-z)(s_3s_4-1)$, so $s_3s_4 = 1$. Let $s_3 = t$ and $s_4 = t^{-1}$. Since $r_{\\tilde{M}}(\\{x_1,x_3,f_2\\}) = r_{\\tilde{M}}(\\{x_1,x_2,f_3\\}) = 2$, we have $\\alpha_1 = t(1 + \\alpha_2^{-1})$ and $\\alpha_1 + (1-\\alpha_2)^{-1} = t$. A computation gives $\\alpha_2 = (1+t)^{-1}$, contradicting $\\alpha_2 \\notin \\operatorname{GF}(q)$.\n\nWe now precisely determine the matrices $A$ which, when appended to a matrix in ${\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(t-1,q)$, yield a matroid with no ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$-minor; these matrices are all essentially restrictions of ${\\widehat A}(t-1,q)$ and ${{\\overline}A}(t-1,q)$. We also give an alternative characterisation of these matrices in terms of the subspaces $L(x)$ defined as above. This is equivalent to a treatment of the special case of our main theorem where $M$ has a spanning projective geometry restriction.\n\n\\[magic\\] Let $q$ be a prime power, $t \\ge 3$ be an integer and $G_t \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(t-1,q)$. If $A \\in \\operatorname{GF}(q^2)^{[t] \\times Y}$ and $M = M(A\\ |\\ G_t)$ then the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  \\[m1\\] $M$ has a minor in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$;\n\n2.  \\[m2\\] $\\operatorname{si}(M)$ is not projectively equivalent to a restriction of either $M({\\widehat A}(t-1,q))$ or $M({{\\overline}A}(t-1,q))$;\n\n3.  \\[m3\\] there exists a set $Z \\subseteq Y$, independent in $M$, such that $|Z|\\in \\{2,3\\}$ and the subspaces $L(A_z): z \\in Z$ each have dimension $2$ and have trivial intersection.\n\nMoreover, if $t \\ge 5$ and (\\[m3\\]) is satisfied by a set $Z$ of size $2$, then the matroid $M {/}Z {\\setminus \\!}(Y-Z)$ also has a minor in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$.\n\nWe call a matrix $A$ satisfying the conditions in this lemma *$q$-bad* and if (\\[m3\\]) holds with $|Z| = 2$ we call $A$ *strongly $q$-bad*. Note that property (\\[m3\\]), and therefore (strong) $q$-badness, is invariant under $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row equivalence.\n\nLet $b_1, \\dotsc, b_t$ be the standard basis vectors of $\\operatorname{GF}(q)^t$. We showed in Lemmas\u00a0\\[lregular\\] and\u00a0\\[hregular\\] that ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ and ${{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(n-1,q)$ are $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular and in Lemma\u00a0\\[obad\\] that the matroids in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$ are not, so (\\[m1\\]) implies (\\[m2\\]).\n\nSuppose that (\\[m2\\]) holds. Note that (\\[m3\\]) and its negation are invariant under $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-equivalence. Let $Y' = \\{y \\in Y, \\dim(L(A_y)) = 2\\}$ and ${\\mathcal{L}}= \\{L(A_y): y \\in Y'\\}$, noting that every $y \\in Y - Y'$ is a loop or is parallel to some column of $G_t$, so $\\operatorname{si}(M {\\setminus \\!}(Y-Y')) \\cong \\operatorname{si}(M)$. If there exist $z_1,z_2 \\in Y'$ such that $L(A_{z_1})$ and $L(A_{z_2})$ are skew then $Z = \\{z_1,z_2\\}$ satisfies (\\[m3\\]), so we may assume that $Y'$ contains no such pair.\n\nIf all subspaces in ${\\mathcal{L}}$ have a dimension-$1$ subspace in common, then, by applying $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-operations, we may assume that this subspace is $\\operatorname{span}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q)}(b_1)$. This gives a matrix representation of $\\operatorname{si}(M)$ that is, up to column scaling, a submatrix of ${\\widehat A}(t-1,q)$, contradicting (\\[m2\\]). We may therefore assume that $\\bigcap {\\mathcal{L}}$ is trivial.\n\nTherefore no pair of subspaces in ${\\mathcal{L}}$ are orthogonal but there is no dimension-$1$ subspace common to all subspaces in ${\\mathcal{L}}$. It follows routinely that there is some dimension-$3$ subspace $P$ of $\\operatorname{GF}(q)^t$ containing all subspaces in ${\\mathcal{L}}$, so $r_M(Y') \\le 3$.\n\nIf $r_M(Y') \\le 2$ then there is a dimension-$2$ subspace $L_0$ of $\\operatorname{span}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)}(P)$ containing $A[Y']$. By Lemma\u00a0\\[gfqvectorinplane\\], $L_0$ contains a nonzero $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-vector $v$. Let $\\{v,w\\}$ be a basis for $L_0$. After $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-operations we may assume that $\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}$ is a basis for $P$, that $v = b_3$, and that $w \\in \\operatorname{cl}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)}(\\{b_1,b_2\\})-\\operatorname{cl}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)}(b_2)$. Moreover, after row-scalings over $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$ we may assume that either $w = b_1$ or $w = b_1 + \\omega b_2$. Since $r_M(Y') = 2$ it follows that $\\operatorname{si}(M)$ is projectively equivalent to a restricition of ${\\widehat A}(t-1,q)$ or ${{\\overline}A}(t-1,q)$, contradicting (\\[m2\\]).\n\nIf $r_M(Y') = 3$ then let $Z = \\{z_1,z_2,z_3\\}$ be a basis for $Y'$. Let $L_i = L(A_{z_i})$ for each $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. Since $r_M(Z) = 3$, the lines $L_1,L_2,L_3$ are not all equal, so we may assume that $L_1 \\notin \\{L_2,L_3\\}$. If $L_1,L_2,L_3$ have no dimension-$1$ subspace in common then (\\[m3\\]) holds, so we may assume that $L_1 \\cap L_2 \\cap L_3$ has dimension $1$. Moreover we know that there is some other subspace $L_4 = L(A_{z_4}) \\in {\\mathcal{L}}$ not containing $L_1 \\cap L_2 \\cap L_3$, as $\\bigcap {\\mathcal{L}}$ is trivial. Now $L_1 \\cap L_2 \\cap L_4$ and $L_1 \\cap L_3 \\cap L_4$ are both trivial, and either $\\{z_1,z_2,z_4\\}$ or $\\{z_1,z_3,z_4\\}$ has rank $3$ in $M$. Therefore (\\[m3\\]) holds.\n\nFinally, suppose that (\\[m3\\]) holds. If $|Z| = 2$ then let $Z = \\{z_1,z_2\\}$. By applying $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-operations if necessary we may assume that $L(z_1) = \\operatorname{span}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q)}(\\{b_1,b_2\\})$ and $L(z_2) = \\operatorname{span}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q)}(\\{b_3,b_4\\})$. Let $X$ be the set of columns of $G_t$ contained in $\\operatorname{span}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q)}(L(z_1) \\cup L(z_2))$ and $N = M|(X \\cup \\{z_1,z_2\\})$. We have $$\\begin{aligned}\n     N \\approx M \\kbordermatrix{\n    &  z_1 & z_2 & X \\\\\n    &  1   & 0   &   & \\\\\n    & \\alpha_1 & 0 & \\dotsc  \\\\\n    & 0 & 1 &       \\dotsc  \\\\\n    & 0 & \\alpha_2 &   \\\\\n    },\n    \\end{aligned}$$ for some $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\in \\operatorname{GF}(q^2)-\\operatorname{GF}(q)$, where the matrix contains exactly one column from each parallel class in $\\operatorname{GF}(q)^4$. Therefore, $N {/}z_1$ is represented by a matrix having a submatrix containing as columns at least one nonzero vector from each parallel class of $\\operatorname{GF}(q)^3$, as well as columns parallel to $(0,1,\\alpha_2)^T,(-\\alpha_1,1,0)^T$ and $ (-\\alpha_1,0,1)^T$. Restricting $N {/}z_1$ to this submatrix yields a matroid in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$. Moreover, if $t \\ge 5$ then let $X'$ be the set of columns of $t$ contained in $\\operatorname{span}_{\\operatorname{GF}(q)}(L(z_1) \\cup L(z_2) \\cup \\{t_5\\})$ and let $N' = M|(X' \\cup \\{z_1,z_2\\})$. It is easy to see by a similar argument to the above that $N' {/}\\{z_1,z_2\\}$, which is a restriction of $M {/}Z {\\setminus \\!}(Y-Z)$, has a spanning restriction in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$.\n\nIf (\\[m3\\]) holds for some $Z$ of size $3$ but for no $2$-element subset of $Z$, then $Z$ contains three dimension-$2$ subspaces, all contained in a common dimension-$3$ subspace, with trivial intersection. This dimension-$3$ subspace corresponds to a plane $P$ of the spanning $\\operatorname{PG}(t-1,q)$-restriction of $M$, and clearly $M|(P \\cup Z) \\in {\\mathcal{O}}(q)$.\n\nTangles {#tanglesec1}\n=======\n\nOur tool for constructing minors in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$ given a projective geometry minor (rather than a spanning restriction as in Lemma\u00a0\\[magic\\]) is the *tangle*. Tangles were introduced for graphs, and implicitly for matroids, by Robertson and Seymour \\[\\[gmx\\]\\] and were later extended explicitly to matroids \\[\\[d95\\],\\[ggrw06\\]\\]. The techniques in this section and the next follow \\[\\[ggwnonprime\\]\\].\n\nLet $M$ be a matroid and let $\\theta \\in {\\mathbb Z}^+$. A set $X \\subseteq E(M)$ is *$k$-separating in $M$* if $\\lambda_M(X) < k$. A collection ${\\mathcal{T}}$ of subsets of $E(M)$ is a *tangle of order $\\theta$* if\n\n1.  Every set in $T$ is $(\\theta-1)$-separating in $M$ and, for each $(\\theta-1)$-separating set $X \\subseteq E(M)$, either $X \\in T$ or $E(M) - X \\in {\\mathcal{T}}$;\n\n2.  if $A,B,C \\in {\\mathcal{T}}$ then $A \\cup B \\cup C \\ne E(M)$; and\n\n3.  $E(M) - \\{e\\} \\notin {\\mathcal{T}}$ for each $e \\in E(M)$.\n\nWe refer to the sets in ${\\mathcal{T}}$ as *${\\mathcal{T}}$-small*. Given a tangle of order $\\theta$ on a matroid $M$ and a set $X \\subseteq E(M)$, we set $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(X) = \\theta - 1$ if $X$ is contained in no ${\\mathcal{T}}$-small set, and $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(X) = \\min\\{\\lambda_M(Z): X \\subseteq Z \\in {\\mathcal{T}}\\}$ otherwise. The proof of our first lemma appears in \\[\\[ggrw06\\]\\]:\n\n\\[tanglematroid\\] If ${\\mathcal{T}}$ is a tangle of order $\\theta$ on a matroid $M$, then $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}}$ is the rank function of a rank-$(\\theta-1)$ matroid on $E(M)$.\n\nThis matroid, which we denote $M({\\mathcal{T}})$, is the *tangle matroid*. The next lemma is easily proved:\n\n\\[tangleminor\\] If $N$ is a minor of a matroid $M$ and ${\\mathcal{T}}_N$ is a tangle of order $\\theta$ on $N$, then $\\{X \\subseteq E(M): \\lambda_M(X) < \\theta-1, X \\cap E(N) \\in {\\mathcal{T}}_N\\}$ is a tangle of order $\\theta$ on $M$.\n\nThis tangle is the tangle on $M$ *induced* by ${\\mathcal{T}}_N$.\n\nIf $M$ is a matroid and $k$ is an integer, then we write ${\\mathcal{T}}_k(M)$ for the collection of $(k-1)$-separating sets of $M$ that are neither spanning nor cospanning. For example, if $M \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$ and $n \\ge k$, then ${\\mathcal{T}}_k(M)$ is simply the collection of subsets of $E(M)$ of rank at most $k-2$. Since $3\\frac{q^{n-2}-1}{q-1} < \\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$, no three such subsets have union $E(M)$, and we easily have the following:\n\n\\[pgtangle\\] If $q$ is a prime power, $n \\in {\\mathbb Z}^+$, and $M \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$, then ${\\mathcal{T}}_n(M)$ is a tangle of order $n$ in $M$.\n\nIf $M$ is a matroid with a $\\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$-minor $N$, then we write ${\\mathcal{T}}_n(M,N)$ for the tangle of order $n$ in $M$ induced by ${\\mathcal{T}}_n(N)$.\n\nThe next result is a slight variation of a lemma from \\[\\[ggwnonprime\\]\\].\n\n\\[tanglecontract\\] Let $k \\in {\\mathbb Z}^+$, let $M$ be a matroid and let $N$ be a minor of $M$ such that ${\\mathcal{T}}_k(N)$ is a tangle. If $X \\subseteq E(M)$ is contained in a ${\\mathcal{T}}_k(M,N)$-small set, then there is a minor $M'$ of $M$ such that $M'|X = M|X$, $M'$ has $N$ as a minor, and $X$ is contained in a ${\\mathcal{T}}_k(M',N)$-small set $X'$ such that $E(M') = E(N) \\cup X'$ and $\\lambda_{M'}(X') = \\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_k(M',N)}(X) = \\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_k(M,N)}(X)$.\n\nLet $b = r_{{\\mathcal{T}}_k(M,N)}(X)$ and let $M'$ be a minimal minor of $M$ such that $N$ is a minor of $M$, $M|X = M'|X$ and $r_{{\\mathcal{T}}_k(M',N)}(X) = b$. Let ${\\mathcal{T}}= {\\mathcal{T}}_k(M',N)$ and $X' = \\operatorname{cl}_{M({\\mathcal{T}})}(X)$. It remains to show that $E(M') = X' \\cup E(N)$. If not, there is some $e \\in E(M') - X' \\cup E(N)$. Since $\\operatorname{cl}_{M'}(X) \\subseteq X'$, we know that $M|X$ is a restriction of both $M {/}e$ and $M {\\setminus \\!}e$. If $N$ is a minor of $M {/}e$, and so by choice of $M$ we have $r_{{\\mathcal{T}}_k(M {/}e,N)}(X) \\le b-1$. Therefore there is some set $Z \\in {\\mathcal{T}}_k(M {/}e,N)$ such that $\\lambda_{M' {/}e}(Z) \\le b-1$ and $X \\subseteq Z$. Therefore $Z \\cup \\{e\\} \\in {\\mathcal{T}}$ and $\\lambda_{M'}(Z \\cup \\{e\\}) \\le b$ so $r_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(X \\cup \\{e\\}) = r_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(X)$ and $e \\in \\operatorname{cl}_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(X)$, a contradiction. The case where $N$ is a minor of $M {\\setminus \\!}e$ is similar.\n\nUsing a Tangle {#tanglesec2}\n==============\n\nOur first lemma allows us to find an affine geometry restriction in a dense $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-representable matroid $M$ after contracting a subset of an arbitrary set of bounded size. A stronger qualitative version of this lemma (in which such a restriction is found in $M$ itself) follows from the density Hales-Jewett theorem \\[\\[fk91\\]\\], but the proof of this result is much easier and we obtain a constructive bound.\n\n\\[densegfq\\] Let $\\alpha \\in {\\mathbb R}^+$, $q$ be a prime power, and $n,h,k \\in {\\mathbb Z}^+$ satisfy $n \\ge (2+k)h + \\log_q(2/\\alpha)$ and $k \\ge 2q^h(1/\\alpha-1)$. If $M$ is a rank-$r$ $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-representable matroid with $r \\ge n$ and ${\\epsilon}(M) \\ge \\alpha|\\operatorname{PG}(r-1,q)|$ then for each rank-$hk$ independent set $C$ in $M$, there exists $C' \\subseteq C$ such that $M {/}C'$ has an $\\operatorname{AG}(h,q)$-restriction.\n\nLet $(C_1,C_2, \\dotsc, C_k)$ be a partition of $C$ into sets of size $h$, and for each $i \\in \\{0, \\dotsc, k\\}$ let $M_i = M {/}(C_1 \\cup \\dotsc \\cup C_i)$ and $\\delta_i = {\\epsilon}(M_i)/|\\operatorname{PG}(r(M_i)-1,q)|$, noting that $\\delta_0 \\ge \\alpha$ and $\\delta_i \\le 1$ for each $i$. Let $x = \\tfrac{1}{2}q^{-h}$ and let $j$ be maximal such that $j \\le k$ and $\\delta_j \\ge \\alpha(1+x)^j$. If $j = k$ then we have $\\delta_k \\ge \\alpha(1+x)^k > \\alpha(1+kx) \\ge 1,$ a contradiction. Therefore $j < k$, and we have $\\delta_j \\ge \\alpha(1+x)^j$ and $\\delta_{j+1} < \\alpha(1+x)^{j+1}$.\n\nLet $F = \\operatorname{cl}_{M_j}(C_{j+1})$ and ${\\mathcal{F}}$ be the collection of rank-$(h+1)$ flats of $M_j$ containing $F$; we have ${\\epsilon}(M_{j+1}) = |{\\mathcal{F}}|$ and ${\\epsilon}(M_j) = {\\epsilon}(M_j|F) + \\sum_{H \\in {\\mathcal{F}}}({\\epsilon}(M_j|H)-{\\epsilon}(M_j|F))$. We may assume that $M_j|H \\not\\cong \\operatorname{AG}(h,q)$ for each $H \\in {\\mathcal{F}}$, and therefore that ${\\epsilon}(M_j|H) - {\\epsilon}(M_j|F) < q^h$ for each $H \\in {\\mathcal{F}}$. Let $r = r(M_j) = n-hk$. Now $$\\begin{aligned}\n            \\alpha(1+x)^j\\frac{q^r-1}{q-1} & \\le {\\epsilon}(M_j) \\\\\n                                         & = {\\epsilon}(M_j|F) + \\sum_{H \\in {\\mathcal{F}}}({\\epsilon}(M_j|H)-{\\epsilon}(M_j|F))\\\\\n                                         & \\le \\frac{q^h-1}{q-1} + (q^h-1){\\epsilon}(M_{j+1})\\\\\n                                         & < \\frac{q^h-1}{q-1} + \\alpha(q^h-1)(1+x)^{j+1}\\frac{q^{r-h}-1}{q-1}.\n        \\end{aligned}$$ Simplifying this inequality gives $$x(q^r-1) + \\frac{q^h-1}{(1+x)^j\\alpha} > (1+x)(q^h + q^{r-h}-2),$$ and so, using $x > 0$ and $q^h \\ge 2$, we have $xq^r + q^h/\\alpha > q^{r-h}$. This implies that $q^r < 2q^{2h}/\\alpha$, contradicting $r \\ge 2h + \\log_q(2/ \\alpha)$.\n\nWe now combine the previous lemma and the machinery of tangles to show that, given a small restriction of $M$ with given \u2018connectivity\u2019 to a large projective geometry minor of $M$, we can realise the same connectivity to a projective geometry restriction in a minor of $M$. The \u2018qualitative\u2019 version of this lemma, on whose proof ours is based, will appear in \\[\\[ggwnonprime\\]\\].\n\n\\[tanglecontractnumbers\\] Let $q$ be a prime power, let $h,a \\in {\\mathbb Z}^+$ satisfy $a \\le h$ and let $n = 2h(1+q^{h+a})+a+2$. If $M$ is a matroid with a $\\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$-minor $N$ and $X\\subseteq E(M)$ is a set such that $r_M(X) \\le a$ and $M {\\setminus \\!}X$ is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-representable, then there is a minor $M'$ of $M$ and a $\\operatorname{PG}(h-1,q)$-restriction $N'$ of $M'$ such that $E(M') = E(N') \\cup X$, $M'|X = M|X$ and $\\lambda_{M'}(X) = \\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_k(M,N)}(X)$.\n\nLet $k = 2q^{h+a}$ and $\\alpha = (q^a + 1)^{-1}$, noting that $h,k,n$ and $\\alpha$ satisfy the numerical conditions in Lemma\u00a0\\[densegfq\\]. Let $b = \\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_n(M,N)}(X)$. By Lemma\u00a0\\[tanglecontract\\] there is a minor $M_1$ of $M$ having $N$ as a minor and a ${\\mathcal{T}}_n(M_1,N)$-small set $X_1$ containing $X$ such that $E(M_1) = E(N) \\cup X_1$ and $\\lambda_{M_1}(X_1) = \\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_{n}(M_1,N)}(X) = b$.\n\nNote for each independent set $C$ of $N$ that ${\\mathcal{T}}_{n-|C|}(N{/}C)$ is a tangle of order $n - |C|$ on $N {/}C$. Let $C$ be a maximal independent set of $N {\\setminus \\!}(X \\cap E(N))$ so that\n\n1.  $|C| \\le hk$,\n\n2.  $M_1|X = (M_1 {/}C)|X$, and\n\n3.  \\[c3\\]$\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_{n-|C'|}(M_1 {/}C',N {/}C')}(X) = b$ for all $C' \\subseteq C$.\n\nLet $M_2 = M_1 {/}C$, $N_2 = N {/}C$, ${\\mathcal{T}}= {\\mathcal{T}}_{n-|C|}(M_2,N_2)$ and $X' = \\operatorname{cl}_{M({\\mathcal{T}})}(X)$.\n\n$|C| = hk$.\n\nSuppose that $|C| \\le hk-1$. Since $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(X') = b \\le n - hk < n - |C|$, we have $X' \\in {\\mathcal{T}}$, so $E(N_2) - X'$ is spanning in $N_2$. Further note that $r_{M_2}(X) = a < n - |C|$; let $e \\in E(N_2) - X' - \\operatorname{cl}_{M_2}(X)$. By choice of $C$ and $e$, we may assume that $X$ has rank at most $b-1$ in ${\\mathcal{T}}_{n  - |C' \\cup \\{e\\}|}(M_2 {/}e,N_2 {/}e)$ for some $C' \\subseteq C$, so there is some set $Z$ such that $C' \\cup \\{e\\} \\subseteq Z$, $\\lambda_{M_2 {/}e}(Z) \\le b-1$ and $Z \\cap E(N_2 {/}e)$ is not spanning in $N_2 {/}e$. Therefore $(Z \\cup e) \\cap E(N_2)$ is not spanning in $N_2$ and $\\lambda_{M_2}(Z \\cup \\{e\\}) \\le b$. It follows that $e \\in \\operatorname{cl}_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(X) = X'$, a contradiction.\n\nSince $X_1 \\cap E(N)$ is not spanning in $N$ and $N$ is round, it follows that $r_{N}(X_1 \\cap E(N)) = \\lambda_{N}(X_1 \\cap E(N)) \\le \\lambda_{M_1}(X_1) = b$. Therefore $n \\le r(M_1|E(N)) \\le n + b$. Now $$\\begin{aligned}\n            {\\epsilon}(M_1 {\\setminus \\!}X_1) &\\ge \\frac{q^n-1}{q-1} - \\frac{q^b-1}{q-1}\\\\ &\\ge (q^b+1)^{-1}\\frac{q^{n+b}-1}{q-1}\\\\ & \\ge \\alpha|\\operatorname{PG}(r(M_1|E(N))-1,q)|.\n        \\end{aligned}$$ The matroid $M_1|E(N)$ is a minor of $M {\\setminus \\!}X$ and is therefore $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-representable. Moreover, $C$ is an $hk$-element independent subset of $E(N)$, so by Lemma\u00a0\\[densegfq\\] there is a set $C' \\subseteq C$ such that $(M_1|E(N)) {/}C'$ has an $\\operatorname{AG}(h,q)$-restriction $(M_1 {/}C')|A$. Let ${\\mathcal{T}}' = {\\mathcal{T}}_{n-|C'|}(M_1 {/}C', N {/}C')$. Now $N {/}C'$ is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-representable and ${\\epsilon}((N {/}C')|A) = q^h$, so $r_{(N {/}C')|A} \\ge h+1 > b$. Therefore $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}'}(A) \\ge \\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_{n-|C'|}(N {/}C')}(A) \\ge b$. It follows that $\\kappa_{M_1 {/}C'}(X,A) = b$, as otherwise $M_1 {/}C'$ has a $b$-separation for which neither side is ${\\mathcal{T}}'$-small.\n\nBy Theorem\u00a0\\[linking\\], there is a minor $M_1'$ of $M_1 {/}C'$ with $E(M_1') = X \\cup A$, $M_1'|X = (M_1 {/}C')|X = M|X$, $M_1'|A = (M_1 {/}C')|A \\cong \\operatorname{AG}(h,q)$ and $\\lambda_{M_1'}(X) = b$. Since $r(M_1'|A) =h+1 > b$, there is some $e \\in A - \\operatorname{cl}_{M_1'}(X)$. Contracting $e$ and simplifying yields the required minor $M'$.\n\nNote in the above lemma that, in the special case where $M$ is round we have $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}_k(M,N)}(X) = r_M(X)$; it follows that $N'$ is spanning in $M'$.\n\nAugmenting Structure\n====================\n\nWe now consider a matroid $M$ and an element $e \\in E(M)$ such that $\\operatorname{si}(M {/}e)$ is a restriction of ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(r(M)-2,q)$ or ${{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(r(M)-2,q)$; we essentially argue that $M$ itself either has one of these two structures, or satisfies some constructive condition certifying otherwise. Unfortunately these hypotheses and outcomes are somewhat opaque in the two lemmas that follow; Theorem\u00a0\\[maintech\\] will unify them.\n\nWe consider a slight variation of contraction in this section for ease of notation. If $e$ is a nonloop of a represented matroid $M$, then we let $M {/\\!\\!/}e$ denote the represented matroid $M' {/}e'$, where $M'$ is obtained from $M$ by extending $e$ in parallel by an element $e'$. Thus, $e$ is a loop of $M {/\\!\\!/}e$, and we have $M {/}e = (M {/\\!\\!/}e) {\\setminus \\!}e$ and $E(M {/\\!\\!/}e) = E(M)$. Note that if $M {/\\!\\!/}e \\approx M(A)$ for some ${\\mathbb F}$-matrix $A$, then $M \\approx M(A')$ for some matrix $A'$ obtained by appending a single row to $A$.\n\n\\[haugment\\] Let ${\\mathbb F}= {\\mathbb F}_0(\\omega)$ be a degree-$2$ extension field of a field ${\\mathbb F}_0$.

(Here $|S| = 4$ and $|X| = 2$.)\n\nSince $M {/\\!\\!/}e \\approx M\\binom{u_0 + \\omega v_0}{R}$, we have $M \\approx M\\binom{P_1 + \\omega Q_1}{R}$ for some $P_1,Q_1 \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{[2] \\times E(M)}$. Let $W^+$ be the matrix in (\\[a3\\]) with $P,Q = P_1,Q_1$ and let $M^+ = M(W^+)$. Note that $M \\approx M^+ {/}X {\\setminus \\!}S$ and $r(M^+) = r+ 2$. If (\\[a3\\]) does not hold for $P_1,Q_1$, then there are sets $Z,K \\subseteq E(M^+)$ such that $r_M(K) \\ge 4$, with $S\\cup X \\subseteq Z \\subseteq  E(M^+) - K$ and $\\lambda_{M^+}(Z) \\le 3$. Let $(I,J) = (E(M) \\cap Z,E(M)-Z)$. Note that $r_{M^+}(Z) \\ge r_{M^+}(S) = 4$. We have $\\lambda_{M}(I) \\le \\lambda_{M^+}(Z) \\le 3$, so vertical $5$-connectivity of $M$ gives $\\min(r_M(I),r_M(J)) \\le 3$. But $r_M(J) \\ge r_M(K) \\ge 4$, so $r_M(I) \\le 3$. This gives $r_{M^+}(Z) \\le 5$ and, by vertical $5$-connectivity of $M$, $r_M(J) = r$.\n\nNote that $0 \\le r_{M^+}(J) - r_M(J) \\le r(M^+)-r(M) = 2$. We have $r = r_M(J) = \\operatorname{rank}\\left(\\binom{P_1+\\omega Q_1}{R}[J]\\right)$ and $r_{M^+}(J) = \\operatorname{rank}(W^+[J])$. By Lemma\u00a0\\[sunday\\], $\\binom{P_1+ \\omega Q_1}{R}[J]$ is row-equivalent to a matrix $\\binom{P' + \\omega Q'}{R[J]}$, where $$\\operatorname{rank}(Q') = \\operatorname{rank}(W^+[J])-\\operatorname{rank}\\left(\\tbinom{P_1 + \\omega Q_1}{R}[J]\\right) = r_{M^+}(J)-r.$$ Therefore $\\binom{P_1+ \\omega Q_1}{R}$ is row-equivalent to a matrix $\\binom{P + \\omega Q}{R}$ where $Q[J] = Q'$. Now $M = M\\binom{P + \\omega Q}{R}$ and $$\\begin{aligned}\n            3 & \\ge \\lambda_{M^+}(Z) \\\\\n              & = r_{M^+}(Z) + r_{M^+}(J) - r(M^+) \\\\\n              & = (4 + \\operatorname{rank}(R[I])) + (r + \\operatorname{rank}(Q')) - (r + 2),\\\\\n              & = 2 + \\operatorname{rank}(R[I]) + \\operatorname{rank}(Q[J]) \n        \\end{aligned}$$ so $\\operatorname{rank}(R[I]) + \\operatorname{rank}(Q[J]) \\le 1$.

Let $W^+$ be the matrix in (\\[b2\\]) with $P,Q = P_1,Q_1$ and let $M^+ = M(W^+).$ As before, we have $M \\approx M^+ {/}X {\\setminus \\!}S$, $r(M^+) = r+3$ and we may assume that there are sets $Z,K \\subseteq E(M^+)$ with $r_M(K) \\ge 5$ such that $S\\cup X \\subseteq Z \\subseteq E(M) - K$ and $\\lambda_{M^+}(Z) \\le 4$.\n\nNow $\\lambda_{M}(E(M) \\cap Z) \\le \\lambda_{M^+}(Z) \\le 4$, so vertical $6$-connectivity of $M$ gives $\\min(r_M(E(M) \\cap Z),r(M {\\setminus \\!}Z)) \\le 4$, but $r(M {\\setminus \\!}Z) \\ge r_M(K) \\ge 5$, so $r_M(E(M) \\cap Z) \\le 4$ and thus $r_{M^+}(Z) \\le 7$ and $r_{M^+}(Z) \\in \\{6,7\\}$. Let $F = \\operatorname{cl}_{M^+}(Z)$, let $(I_1,J_1) = (E(M) \\cap F, E(M)-F)$ and let $(I,J) = (I_0 \\cup I_1,J_0 \\cap J_1)$.\n\nWe have $r_M(I) \\le (r_{M {/\\!\\!/}e}(I_0)+1)  + r_{M}(I_1) \\le 3+4 = 7$, so by vertical $9$-connectivity of $M$ we get $r_M(J) = r$. Therefore $r_{M^+}(J) \\ge r$. Moreover $r_{M^+}(J_1) = r(M^+) + \\lambda_{M^+}(J_1) - r_{M^+}(F) \\le (r+3) + 4 - r_{M^+}(F) = r+7-r_{M^+}(Z)$, so $r_{M^+}(J_1) \\in \\{r,r+1\\}$. We consider the two cases separately.\n\nIf $r_{M^+}(J_1) = r$ then $r_{M^+}(J) = r$ and $W^+[J]$ is a rank-$r$ matrix with $(r+3)$ rows, so by Lemma\u00a0\\[sunday\\], $\\binom{P_1+\\omega Q_1}{R}[J]$ is row-equivalent to a matrix $\\binom{P'}{R[J]}$ where $P' \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{[3] \\times J}$. Therefore $\\binom{P_1 + \\omega Q_1}{R}$ is row-equivalent to a matrix $\\binom{P + \\omega Q}{R}$ where $Q[J] = 0$. Now $M \\approx M\\binom{P + \\omega Q}{R}$ and $r_M(I) \\le r_{M^+}(Z) - 3 \\le 4$, so (\\[b1\\]) holds.\n\nIf $r_{M^+}(J_1) = r+1$ then $r_{M^+}(F) = 6 = r_{M^+}(S)$ so $F = \\operatorname{cl}_{M^+}(S)$. It follows that $R[I_1] = 0$. Also, $W^+[J_1]$ is a rank-$(r+1)$ matrix with $r+3$ rows, so by Lemma\u00a0\\[sunday\\] the matrix $\\binom{P_1 + \\omega Q_1}{R}[J_1]$ is row-equivalent to a matrix $\\binom{P' + \\omega Q'}{R[J_1]}$ where $P',Q' \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{[3] \\times J_1}$ and $Q'[J_1]$ has two zero rows. Therefore $\\binom{P_1 + \\omega Q_1}{R}$ is row-equivalent to a matrix $\\binom{P + \\omega Q}{R}$ where $P,Q \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{[3] \\times E(M)}$ and $Q[J_1] = Q'$. Since $R[e] = 0$, it follows that $M {/\\!\\!/}e \\approx M\\binom{P_0' + \\omega Q_0'}{R}$ for some matrices $P',Q' \\in {\\mathbb F}_0^{[2] \\times E(M)}$ with $\\operatorname{rank}(Q_0'[J_1]) \\le \\operatorname{rank}(Q') \\le 1$. We may assume (by applying ${\\mathbb F}_0$-row operations to $P_0' + \\omega Q_0'$ if necessary) that the second row of $Q_0'[J_1]$ is zero. Now $R[I_1] = 0$, so we can scale each column of $\\binom{P_0' + \\omega Q_0'}{R}[I_1]$ to have its second entry in ${\\mathbb F}_0$. This yields an matrix $\\binom{u_0 + \\omega v_0}{R'}$ where $u_0,v_0$ are ${\\mathbb F}_0$-vectors, $R'$ is an ${\\mathbb F}_0$-matrix, and $M {/\\!\\!/}e \\approx M\\binom{u_0 + \\omega v_0}{R'}$, so (\\[b0\\]) holds.\n\nThe Main Theorem\n================\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0\\[obad\\], the abstract matroids corresponding to the represented matroids in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$ are not $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular. By Lemmas\u00a0\\[lregular\\] and\u00a0\\[hregular\\], restrictions of ${{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(r-1,q)$ and ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(r-1,q)$ are $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-regular. The following result, which applies to arbitrary $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-represented matroids, thus has Theorem\u00a0\\[main\\] as a corollary.\n\n\\[maintech\\] Let $q$ be a prime power. If $M$ is a round rank-$r$ $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-represented matroid with a $\\operatorname{PG}(12q^{12}+19,q)$-minor and no minor in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$, then $\\operatorname{si}(M)$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of either $M({\\widehat A}(r-1,q))$ or $M({{\\overline}A}(r-1,q))$.\n\nLet $n = 12q^{12} + 20$ and $N$ be a $\\operatorname{PG}(n-1,q)$-minor of $M$. Let ${\\mathcal{T}}= {\\mathcal{T}}_n(M,N)$.\n\nIf $N$ is spanning in $M$ then, by Lemma\u00a0\\[confinement\\], we have $M \\approx M(A\\ |\\ G_r)$ for some matrices $G_r \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(r-1,q)$ and $A$, and the result follows from Lemma\u00a0\\[magic\\]. We may thus assume inductively that there exists $e \\in E(M)$ so that $N$ is a minor of $M {/}e$ and $\\operatorname{si}(M {/}e)$ is a restriction of either ${\\widehat\\operatorname{PG}}(r-2,q)$ or ${{\\overline}\\operatorname{PG}}(r-2,q)$. We consider these cases in two mutually exclusive claims.\n\nIf the matroid $\\operatorname{si}(M {/}e)$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of $M({\\widehat A}(r-2,q))$ then the theorem holds.\n\nThe matroid $M$ is round (so is vertically $5$-connected) and has a $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)$-representation projectively equivalent to a submatrix of ${\\widehat A}(r-2,q)$; it follows that $M$ and $e$ satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma\u00a0\\[haugment\\]; Define matrices $P,Q,R$ as in the conclusion of the lemma, so $M \\approx M(W)$ where $W = \\binom{P + \\omega Q}{R}$.\n\nIf outcome (\\[a1\\]) of Lemma\u00a0\\[haugment\\] holds then there is a partition $(I,J)$ of $E(M)$ so that $\\operatorname{rank}(R[I]) + \\operatorname{rank}(Q[J]) \\le 1$, so one of these matrices is zero and the other has rank at most $1$. If $R[I] = 0$ and $\\operatorname{rank}(Q[J]) \\le 1$ then we may perform $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-operations in the first two rows so that only the first row of $Q[J]$ is nonzero and then scale each column in $I$ so that the second entry is in $\\{0,1\\}$; since $R[I] = 0$ it follows that $\\operatorname{si}(M)$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of $M({\\widehat A}(r-1,q))$, as required.\n\nIf $Q[J] = 0$ and $\\operatorname{rank}(R[I]) \\le 1$, then let $A = W[I]$. Note that $r_M(I) \\le 3$. Since $Q[J] = 0$, if the matroid $\\operatorname{si}(M(A\\ |\\ G_r))$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of $M({\\widehat A}(r-1,q))$ or $M({{\\overline}A}(r-1,q))$ then so is $\\operatorname{si}(M)$. Otherwise, $A$ is $q$-bad (recall Section\u00a0\\[nonexamples\\] for a definition). By roundness of $M$ and Lemma\u00a0\\[tanglecontractnumbers\\] applied with $a = h = 3$, there is a rank-$3$ minor $M'$ of $M$ with a $\\operatorname{PG}(2,q)$-restriction $N'$ so that $E(M') = E(N') \\cup I$ and $M'|I = M|I$. However $M'$ is obtained from $M$ by contracting and deleting only columns in $W[J]$, so if $G_3 \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(2,q)$ then $M' \\approx M(A'\\ |\\ G_3)$ for some matrix $A'$ that is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-equivalent to $A$; the matrix $A'$ is also $q$-bad, so by Lemma\u00a0\\[magic\\], the matroid $M'$ has a minor in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$.\n\nIf outcome (\\[a3\\]) of the lemma holds then let $W^+$ be the given matrix and $M^+ = M(W^+)$, noting that $M \\approx M^+ {/}X {\\setminus \\!}S$ and that $W^+[S \\cup X]$ is strongly $q$-bad (with $Z = X$). Let ${\\mathcal{T}}^+ = {\\mathcal{T}}_n(M^+,N)$. Since $\\kappa_{M^+}(S \\cup X,K) \\ge 4$ for each basis or cobasis $K$ of $N$, it follows that $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}^+}(S \\cup X) = 4$ and so, by Lemma\u00a0\\[tanglecontractnumbers\\] applied with $a = 4$ and $h = 5$, $M^+$ has a minor $M'$ with a $\\operatorname{PG}(4,q)$-restriction $N'$ so that $E(M') = E(N') \\cup (S \\cup X)$ and $M'|(S \\cup X) = M|(S \\cup X)$. Similarly to the previous case, we have $M' \\approx M(B\\ |\\  G_5)$ for some $G_5 \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(4,q)$ and some matrix $B$ that is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-equivalent to $W^+[S \\cup X]$ and hence strongly $q$-bad. By Lemma\u00a0\\[magic\\], the matroid $M' {/}X {\\setminus \\!}S$, which is a minor of $M$, has a minor in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$, again a contradiction.\n\nIf the matroid $\\operatorname{si}(M {/}e)$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of $M({{\\overline}A}(r-2,q))$ but not to a restriction of $M({\\widehat A}(r-2,q))$ then the theorem holds.\n\nSince $M$ it is vertically $9$-connected. Since $\\operatorname{si}(M {/}e)$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of $M({{\\overline}A}(r-2,q))$, it is easy to see that $M$ and $e$ satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma\u00a0\\[laugment\\]. (The required partition $(I_0,J_0)$ is induced by the line $L_0$ and its complement in the column set of ${{\\overline}A}(r-2,q)$.) If outcome (\\[b0\\]) of the lemma holds then $\\operatorname{si}(M {/}e)$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of $M({\\widehat A}(r-2,q))$, a contradiction. Therefore (\\[b1\\]) or (\\[b2\\]) holds. Let $M \\approx M(W)$ where $W = \\binom{P + \\omega Q}{R}$ as in the lemma.\n\nSuppose that (\\[b1\\]) holds, and let $(I,J)$ be the associated partition of $E(M)$. If $\\operatorname{si}(M((W[I] \\ |\\ G_r)))$ is projectively equivalent to a restriction of $M({\\widehat A}(r-1,q))$ or $M({{\\overline}A}(r-1,q))$ then, as $W[J]$ is a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-matrix, so is $\\operatorname{si}(M)$. Therefore we may assume that this is not the case, so $W[I]$ is $q$-bad. By roundness of $M$ we have $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}}(I) = r_M(I) \\le 4$, so Lemma\u00a0\\[tanglecontractnumbers\\] with $a=h=4$ gives a rank-$4$ minor $M'$ of $M$ with a $\\operatorname{PG}(3,q)$-restriction $N'$ satisfying $E(M') = E(N') \\cup I$ and $M'|I = M|I$. Now $E(M) - E(M') \\subseteq J$ and so $M' \\approx M(B\\ |\\ G_4)$ for some $G_4 \\in {\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{G}}(3,q)$ and some matrix $B$ that is $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-row-equivalent to $W[I]$ and hence $q$-bad. Lemma\u00a0\\[magic\\] implies that $M'$ has a minor in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$, a contradiction.\n\nFinally, suppose that (\\[b2\\]) holds. Let $W^+$ be the matrix given and let $M = M(W^+)$, noting that $M = M^+ {/}X {\\setminus \\!}S$. Let ${\\mathcal{T}}^+ = {\\mathcal{T}}_n(M^+,N)$. Since $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{M}}^+}(S \\cup X, K) \\ge 5$ for each basis or cobasis $K$ of $N$, we have $\\kappa_{{\\mathcal{T}}^+}(S \\cup X) \\ge 5$. By Lemma\u00a0\\[tanglecontractnumbers\\] with $a = h = 6$ there is a minor $M'$ of $M^+$ and a $\\operatorname{PG}(5,q)$-restriction $N'$ of $M'$ so that $E(M') = E(N') \\cup X \\cup S$, $M'|(X \\cup S) = M|(X \\cup S)$ and $\\lambda_{M'}(X \\cup S) \\ge 5$, from which it follows that $6 \\le r(M') \\le 7$.\n\nSince $W^+[E(M)]$ is a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-matrix, we have $M' \\approx M(B\\ | \\ G)$, where $B$ is obtained by appending a row of zeroes above $W^+[S \\cup X]$ and $G$ is a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-representation of $N' \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(5,q)$ with $7$ rows. (If $r(M') = 6$ then the first row of $G$ is also zero). Let $v_0, \\dotsc, v_6$ denote the row vectors of $G$, so $M' {/}X {\\setminus \\!}S \\approx M(W')$, where $$W' = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}v_0 \\\\ v_1 + \\omega v_4 \\\\ v_2 + \\omega v_5 \\\\ v_3 + \\omega v_6 \\end{array}\\right).$$\n\nFor each $i \\in \\{0, \\dotsc, 6\\}$ let $G^i$ be the matrix obtained by removing the $i$th row of $G$. Since $\\tilde{M}(G) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(5,q)$, there is some $i \\in \\{0,\\dotsc,6\\}$ so that $\\tilde{M}(G^i) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(5,q)$. Furthermore, unless $v_0 = 0$ we may choose $i$ to be nonzero. If $v_0 = 0$ then, since $\\tilde{M}(G^0) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(5,q)$, every vector in $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)^4$ with first component zero is a $\\operatorname{GF}(q)$-multiple of some column of $W'$, so $\\operatorname{si}(M(W')) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(2,q^2)$ and $M' {/}X {\\setminus \\!}S$ clearly has a restriction in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$, a contradiction.\n\nOtherwise, we can choose $i$ nonzero such that $\\tilde{M}(G^i) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(5,q)$. We will suppose that $i = 6$; the other cases are similar. Since $G^6$ contains a column from every parallel class in $\\operatorname{GF}(q)^5$, there is some $f \\in E(N')$ so that $G^6[f]$ has all entries zero except its $v_3$-entry which is nonzero. Therefore $W'[f]$ has all entries zero except its last entry which is nonzero. Now consider a representation $W''$ of $M(W') {/}f$ given by removing the $f$-column and last row from $W'$. Since the matrix with rows $v_0,v_1,v_2,v_4,v_5$ has a column in every parallel class in $\\operatorname{GF}(q)^5$, it follows that $W''$ contains a column from every parallel class in $\\operatorname{GF}(q^2)^3$, and so $\\operatorname{si}(M(W'')) \\cong \\operatorname{PG}(2,q^2)$ and $M(W'')$ has a restriction in ${\\mathcal{O}}(q)$, a contradiction.\n\nThe result now follows from the two claims.\n\nAcknowledgements {#acknowledgements .unnumbered}\n================\n\nWe thank Geoff Whittle for suggesting the problem and for his very useful discussions on the proof and techniques used.\n\nReferences {#references .unnumbered}\n==========\n\n[\\[\\]]{}\n\n\\[d95\\] J.S.

    "ar concept.\nA somewhat counter-intuitive mathematical fact is that effective aperture (\\$A_{eff}\\$) and gain (\\$G\\$) are related:\n$$ G = \\frac {4 \\pi A_{eff} } { \\lambda^2 } $$\n\\$\\lambda\\$ is the wavelength, and people tend to develop a misconception here: that the physics of energy transmission are somehow different depending on frequency. They aren't. All electromagnetic radiation decreases with distance according to the inverse square law, be it AM broadcasts, visible light, or gamma radiation. See Is free space path loss dependent on frequency? and Why is antenna aperture a function of wavelength?\nWhat this equation is telling you is this: as frequency decreases and gain remains constant, the aperture increases. But a half-wavelength dipole for 750 kHz is also physically much larger than a half-wavelength dipole for 2.4 GHz, so although they each have the same gain, it would make sense that the 750 kHz dipole has a larger aperture.\nAnother counter-intuitive result is that an ideal dipole which is infinitesimally small has about the same gain (and effective aperture) as a half-wavelength dipole: 1.76 dBi compared to 2.15 dBi, respectively.\nIf that's true, then why don't we use infinitesimally small dipoles everywhere? We could save a lot of space. The reason is that to efficiently couple energy with this tiny antenna, you need some kind of matching network, and those parts introduce losses, degrading the efficiency of the system.\nBut this is still insightful: if you want to maximize received power, focus on minimizing losses first. With the tiny powers you will capture from an antenna, you probably need it to be as efficient as possible, so design for simplicity since each component adds loss. And match your load to the antenna impedance to make the transfer of energy as efficient as possible.\n\n",
    "ustralia\n\nIt comes as a great surprise to many visiting fly fishers to discover that Australia\u2019s northern coastal waters are actually home to the \u201cbig three\u201d of the tropical flats: permit, bonefish and tarpon. However, each has a uniquely Antipodean twist. Our Indo-Pacific permit (we actually boast two species!) is at least as tricky to hook as its Caribbean counterpart, but occurs in far greater numbers. Our bonefish are big and cunning, but often hang out in slightly deeper water than their cousins from other corners of the globe, making them much harder to spot.\n\nOur tarpon are miniature scale models of their much larger Atlantic brethren, rarely exceeding four kilograms (eight pounds) in weight, but punching well above their modest size.\n\nTake your next fly fishing experience to Queensland with Far North Sports Fishing who operate private bespoke charters for up to six people, or check out Nomad Sportfishing Adventures who can accommodate single anglers or groups through to 26 persons throughout the Coral Sea.\n\nThe blue bastard, baramundi and giant herring\n\nBlue Bastard, Exmouth, Western Australia\n\nThrow in golden, diamond and giant trevally, barramundi, queenfish, giant herring (ladyfish), threadfin salmon and barracuda and you\u2019re starting to get a picture of the caliber of shallow water, inshore fly fishing on offer around the lightly-populated north of the country. Check out Fly Fishing Frontiers and True Blue Bonefish, operators who embark on epic fly fishing tours off the Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth Gulf.\n\nWe\u2019re still only scratching the surface. There are other species swimming here that will blow a fly fisher\u2019s mind, like the irreverently named \u201cblue bastard\u201d (seriously \u2014 that\u2019s what it\u2019s called). These powder blue ghosts of the tropical coastal flats look a little like an American drum, but they\u2019re much harder to fool into eating a fly. Should you be lucky or skillful enough to deceive one, the fun has only just begun. These things pull like freight trains, as do the even more vividly-coloured wrasse or \u201cblue bones\u201d they share these warm shallows with.\n\nTuna, yellowtail kingfish and salmon\n\nWestern Australia\n\nThe north of Australia sure doesn't have a monopoly on saltwater fly fishing thrills. Our cooler southern waters also teem with fish that will test your mettle and strip backing from your fly reel.\n\nSome are familiar, like half a dozen or more types of tuna, our sharp-toothed tailor (called bluefish, elf and shad in other parts of the world) and the incredibly powerful southern yellowtail kingfish (an identical cousin of both the Californian and Japanese yellowtails). But there are other less familiar and more exotic contenders on offer, too.\n\nThe so-called Australian salmon is a classic case in point. Known as kahawai in New Zealand, these wonderful fish are not a true salmon at all, but more like a cross between an American striper and a European sea bass. Found in prolific numbers around the southern half of Australia, they regularly top three kilograms (six pounds) and occasionally reach twice that weight. Avid fly-takers and spectacular aerialists when hooked, Australian salmon are dogged opponents on lighter tippets. They represent a worthy prize for any fly fisher as do the pink snapper (squirefish), mulloway (croakers) and Samson fish that share these temperate southern seas with our Aussie salmon. Checkout Sydney Fly Fishing for the top insider information on fly fishing.\n\nBlue, black & striped marlin\n\nSailfish on Fly, Ningaloo Coral Coast, Western Australia\n\nMost of the species described so far can be tackled with #8 and #9 weight fly outfits, but if your aspirations run to even greater heights, there are few better places than Australia to chase a billfish on fly. Indo-Pacific sailfish, black, blue and striped marlin, spearfish, even broadbill swordfish. They\u2019re all here. So why not pack your favourite fly rods and come play?\n\nMore articles like this\n\nSapphire-blue, sub-tropical oceans, clear and clean high-country lakes and mighty rivers provide the setting for fly fishing in Australia. For an adventure that you won\u2019t forget, check out these top fly fishing experiences.\n\nIt's easy to find good quality saltwater fishing in Australia, whether you are casting a line within sight of the Sydney Harbour Bridge or heading out for a full day on the high seas off the coast of Queensland.\n\nAbundance, variety and diversity are the core characteristics of Australian fishing. With around 2,000 marine fish species and another 280 freshwater varieties Australia is a fishing paradise.

    "re console and in fact very few buttons at all, this is thanks to the Virtual Display which replaces the traditional dials. It\u2019s a full width screen that can swap between various modes to display dials, information, gauges or a full width satnav screen with floating dials. It really is an incredible system, though I found navigating it took a lot longer than the time I had to learn. Lucky owners won\u2019t have such time restrictions though. In the centre console there are three air vents which cleverly house the small display and control button in the centre \u2013 definitely one of those features that makes you wonder why someone hasn\u2019t done it before. Another impressive aspect of the TT-RS\u2019s interior is the practicality \u2013 the rear seats are certainly usable for children and adults for short journeys and they fold flat too, making the already spacious boot much bigger and capable of taking a decent amount of stuff. Another bonus is the passenger seat has Isofix mounts too so a child seat can go there.\n\nSo now we\u2019ve gone through the visuals, let\u2019s get to the oily bits. Though the spec list may look familiar \u2013 a 2.5 litre turbocharged 5-cylinder unit, this engine is all new and around 40kg lighter, but now puts out a staggering 394bhp which is enough to propel the TT-RS from 0-62mph in just 3.7 seconds. That\u2019s quicker than the original R8 V10! The power doesn\u2019t let up as the speed increases either, on a closed runway I floored the accelerator and before I knew it the dials were well into three figures and still climbing right up the point where I chickened out at 145mph. It really is staggeringly quick; I dare say that there isn\u2019t much that will keep up at the price point. And then there\u2019s the noise. Oh my, the noise. There\u2019s nothing like a 5-pot burble, but with the sports exhaust this TT absolutely sings \u2013 all burbles, gurgles, turbo whistles and angry barks.\n\nI didn\u2019t get a huge amount of time to explore the handling, but sadly there was the typical Audi RS trait of understeer when pushed into a fast corner. However unlike the old RS3, with the TT-RS I found that if you learn to work around it, adopt a slow-in-fast-out approach to roundabouts, this is a devastatingly quick car point to point. If you were on the roundabouts of Milton Keynes this week and you got passed by a loud grey blur, that was me. Sorry.\n\nSo there\u2019s a brief overview of the TT-RS \u2013 as explained there will be a longer full review soon, but until then hopefully this gives you enough of an insight to go and buy some tickets for this fantastic Audi \u2013 and you can do so right here.",

The V^V^ atom in the complex is five-coordinated by one phenolate O, one imine N and one morpholine N atom of the Schiff base ligand, and by two oxo O atoms, forming a distorted square pyramidal coordination. The V--O and V--N bond lengths (Table 1) are typical and are comparable with those observed in other similar oxovanadium(V) complexes with Schiff bases (Xie *et al.*, 2004; Gao *et al.*, 2005; Hartung *et al.*, 2007; Romanowski *et al.*, 2009).\n\nExperimental {#experimental}\n============\n\n5-Bromosalicylaldehyde (1.0 mmol, 0.201 g), 2-morpholin-4-ylethylamine (1.0 mmol, 0.130 g) and VO(acac)~2~ (1.0 mmol, 0.265 g) were dissolved in MeOH (30 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min to give a yellow solution. After keeping the solution in air for a week, yellow block-shaped crystals were formed at the bottom of the vessel.\n\nRefinement {#refinement}\n==========\n\nH atoms were placed in geometrically idealized positions and constrained to ride on their parent atoms, with C---H distances in the range 0.93--0.97 \u00c5, and with *U*~iso~(H) set at 1.2*U*~eq~(C).\n\nFigures\n=======\n\n![The molecular structure of the title compound, showing the atom-numbering scheme.

All e.s.d.\\'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.\\'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.\\'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.\\'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.\\'s is used for estimating e.s.d.\\'s involving l.s. planes.\n  Refinement. Refinement of *F*^2^ against ALL reflections. The weighted *R*-factor *wR* and goodness of fit *S* are based on *F*^2^, conventional *R*-factors *R* are based on *F*, with *F* set to zero for negative *F*^2^. The threshold expression of *F*^2^ \\> \u03c3(*F*^2^) is used only for calculating *R*-factors(gt) *etc*. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. *R*-factors based on *F*^2^ are statistically about twice as large as those based on *F*, and *R*- factors based on ALL data will be even larger.\n

If your service implementation class implements the Lifecycle interface, then Axis2 will call Lifecycle.init() every time it creates a new instance of the service class. The argument to Lifecycle.init() is the service's ServiceContext. Your init() implementation could save the context object or look up the parameters that you're interested in.\n\n",

But his tough stance on dissidents and the press have seen critics call him a \"dictator.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mahathir said a prime minister, widely expected to be him, would be sworn within a day.",

In vitro, PHMB (MIC = 14.6 microM) and hexamidine diisethionate (MIC = 555 microM) exerted a synergistic effect (fractional inhibitory concentration = 0.06), and miltefosine exhibited antiamoebal activity (MIC = 27.4 microM). In this study, a rat model of chronic A. polyphaga keratitis was obtained and found suitable for assessment of pharmacologic agents.

    "about this. Its authorities have now issued guidelines on accepting pachyderms from devotees.\n\nThe Guruvayoor Devaswom Board has set up an Elephant Expert Committee which will physically examine each animal offered to ensure that the new entrants are no (pardon the phrase) white elephants. Only after the Committee issues a fitness certificate will the temple accept the gift.\n\nDevaswom Administrator P S Mohan says the temple is not against looking after the elephants.\n\n\"[But] we do not want our population of elephants to go up,\" he says.\n\n\"We spend lot of money on maintaining the 62 elephants,\" he adds. \"But we do not consider it a waste of money. We consider it the most essential part of the services rendered by the temple management because the devotees who donate the elephants do it with utmost religious fervour and spirituality.\"\n\nThe elephants are housed on a 12-acre plot, known as Ponnathur Kotta, two kilometres from the temple. Devaswom officials say they spend around Rs 200,000 for the upkeep of each elephant annually. Rs 20 lakhs (Rs 2 million) every year goes as insurance cover. The temple administration has employed 165 people to look after the elephants; then there are food, medical and other expenses, which all tots up to Rs 2.5 crores.\n\nBut the elephants also earn the Guruvayoor temple a hefty revenue. They are much sought after for religious rituals at other temples across the state. Last year, the 62 elephants are estimated to have earned Rs 1 crore (Rs 10 million).\n\nA senior temple official says the elephants can \"never be a great drain on the temple's resources. Our temple is one of the richest in the country and we do not have monetary problems in maintaining the elephants.\"\n\n\"But,\" he adds, \"we do not want to increase the livestock because it is not easy to look after a large herd of captive elephants.\"\n\nNew temple guidelines stipulate that any devotee wishing to donate an elephant should also pay Rs 400,000 towards its upkeep. Instead of donating an elephant, a devotee can also make a 'symbolic offer' by paying Rs 500,000 to the temple.\n\nThe latter provision, temple officials say, makes economic sense for the devotees because an elephant can cost anything between Rs 600,000 and Rs 800,000.\n\n\"If a devotees offers an elephant to the temple, it could cost him more than Rs 10 lakhs (Rs 1 million) including the maintenance charge of Rs 400,000 we now ask for,\" a temple official points out.\n\nBut the new rules have not deterred devotees. Temple officials reveal that eight applications to donate elephants are pending with the temple administration.\n\nK P Krishnan, a frequent visitor to the Guruvayoor temple, says its elephants are the best looked-after pachyderms in the country.\n\n\"The Guruvayoor temple,\" he declares, \"takes care of its elephants much better than the Indian government or Kerala government looks after its citizens.\"",

To receive funding under the IDEA, school districts must adopt procedures to\n\nensure appropriate educational placement of students with disabilities. Id. \u00a7 1413.\n\n       A central requirement of the IDEA is that the district in which a student with disabilities\n\nresides must offer that student a free appropriate public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d), id. \u00a7 1412(a),\n\nwhich entitles each student with a disability to a comprehensive plan, known as an individualized\n\neducation program (\u201cIEP\u201d), that is designed to meet his or her specialized educational needs. Id.\n\n\u00a7 1414(d)(2)(A) (\u201cAt the beginning of each school year, each [state] shall have in effect, for each\n\nchild with a disability in [its] jurisdiction, an individualized education program.\u201d). The IEP must\n\nbe formulated in accordance with the terms of the IDEA and \u201cshould be reasonably calculated to\n\n\n\n1        Like the Magistrate Judge, the Court will adopt the hearing officer\u2019s finding of\nundisputed facts in disposing of this case. See Report at 7 n.2. The facts most relevant to the\ndisposition are that (1) J.W. is a resident of the District of Columbia; (2) J.W. is a child with\nmultiple disabilities; (3) J.W.\u2019s parents took steps \u201cto assist [DCPS] in an eligibility\ndetermination and IEP process\u201d for J.W.; (4) J.W. is parentally enrolled in a private school in the\nDistrict; (5) DCPS determined that J.W. is eligible for special education; (6) J.W.\u2019s parent\u2019s\nrequested that DCPS develop an IEP for J.W.; and (7) DCPS declined the IEP request, stating\nthat it is not obligated to provide J.W. with an IEP until he is enrolled in a DCPS school. Id.,\nquoting Ex. 1 to AR 2\u20133 [Dkt. # 10-1].\n                                                2\n\fenable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\u201d Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 204 (1982).\n\n       When a student with disabilities is parentally placed in a private school, the LEA\n\nresponsible for the district in which the student resides must continue to periodically evaluate the\n\nstudent\u2019s special education needs, either on its own initiative or at the request of the student\u2019s\n\nparents or teacher.

As a result, the LEA has\n\na continuing responsibility to offer a FAPE to a student with disabilities that resides within its\n\ndistrict regardless of whether that student is currently enrolled in a private school. Upon receipt\n\nof an offer of a FAPE, parents have two options: (1) accept the offer of a FAPE and enroll their\n\nstudent in the delegated school, or (2) keep their child in private school. See Ex. 2 to Pl.\u2019s\n\nObject. at 6 [Dkt. # 22-2]. If the parents choose the latter option, any services provided to the\n\nstudent pursuant to the IDEA are governed by 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10) and 34 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 300.130\u2013300.144.     \u201cNo parentally-placed private school child with a disability has an\n\nindividual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child\n\nwould receive if enrolled in a public school.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.137(a).\n\n       The IDEA provides parents of students with disabilities the opportunity to participate in\n\nthe evaluation and placement process. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1414(e), 1415(b)(1).

First, plaintiff argues that the Magistrate Judge did not conduct a proper\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fstatutory analysis because there is a separate statutory framework governing students with\n\ndisabilities who are parentally placed in private schools that eliminates plaintiff\u2019s responsibility\n\nto develop an IEP for J.W. See generally Pl.\u2019s Object. And second, plaintiff objects to the\n\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s Spending Clause argument is not germane and\n\ntherefore need not be addressed. See generally id. Neither objection has merit.\n\n       The separate statutory framework for children who are parentally placed in private school\n\ndoes not support plaintiff\u2019s theory that it is not obligated under the IDEA to develop an IEP for\n\nJ.W. until he enrolls in a public school. See Vinyard, 2013 WL 5302674, at *6\u201310. The IDEA\u2019s\n\nbasic rule is that the state must ensure that \u201c[a] free appropriate public education is available to\n\nall children with disability residing in the State between the ages of 3 and 21.\u201d 20 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). To satisfy that obligation, the state must not only engage in\n\n\u201cchild find,\u201d 2 id. \u00a7 1412(a)(3), but it must also reevaluate and offer a FAPE to \u201ceach child with a\n\ndisability . . . if the [LEA] determines that the educational or related services needs . . . of the\n\nchild warrant a reevaluation[,] or if the child\u2019s parents or teacher requests a reevaluation.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 1414(a)(2); see also Vinyard, 2013 WL 5302674, at *6\u201310. Absent a statutory exception, the\n\nIDEA mandates that a LEA offer a FAPE to all students residing in its district.\n\n       Here, J.W. is undisputedly a child with a disability who resides in the District of\n\nColumbia, and he therefore falls within the IDEA\u2019s basic rule provision. As a result, when his\n\nparents requested that plaintiff reevaluate J.W. and develop on IEP for him, plaintiff was\n\n\n\n\n2      The \u201cchild find\u201d provision of the IDEA imposes an obligation on a LEA to locate and\nevaluate all children with disabilities residing within its district. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(3). This\nprovision is not at issue in this case.\n                                                 5\n\frequired to honor that request and make available a FAPE to J.W. regardless of his current\n\nparental enrollment in a private school. 3\n\n       Plaintiff relies entirely on the separate statutory framework governing children who are\n\nparentally placed in private schools to assert that it is nonetheless not obligated to develop an IEP\n\nfor J.W. But that separate statutory framework does not create an exception to the general rule\n\nthat the LEA offer a FAPE to all students with disabilities that reside in its district. See 20\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1); Vinyard, 2013 WL 5302674, at *7 (\u201c[S]ection 1412(a)(10) . . . does not\n\nlimit when the school district is required to propose a FAPE when requested by the parents.\u201d).\n\nInstead, as the plain language of section 1412(a)(10)(A)(i) indicates, that provision governs an\n\nLEA\u2019s responsibility to provide special education and related services to children with\n\ndisabilities that are \u201cenrolled in private schools by their parents.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(A)\n\n(emphases added) (explaining that \u201cprovision is made for the participation of those children in\n\nthe program assisted or carried out under this subchapter by providing for such children special\n\neducation and related services\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch services . . . may be provided to the children on\n\nthe premises of private, including religious, schools, to the extent consistent with law\u201d); Vinyard,\n\n2013 WL 5302674, at *7 (\u201cBut section 1412(a)(10) merely governs the school district\u2019s\n\nobligations after the parents decline a FAPE offered by the school district . . . .\u201d). Similarly, the\n\nplain language of 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.137 demonstrates that it is meant to limit the services the LEA\n\nmust provide, not the obligation to evaluate or reevaluate and offer a FAPE to a student: \u201cNo\n\nparentally-placed private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or\n\nall of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a\n\npublic school.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.137(a) (emphasis added); see also id. \u00a7 300.137(b)(1) (emphasis\n\n\n3       The fact that J.W.\u2019s parents requested that plaintiff develop an IEP for J.W. distinguishes\nthis case from D.P. v. Council Rock School District, 482 Fed. App\u2019x 669 (3d Cir. 2012).\n                                                 6\n\fadded) (\u201cDecisions about the services that will be provided . . . .\u201d). Consequently, the only two\n\nprovisions to which plaintiff directs this Court do not support plaintiff\u2019s position that it is under\n\nno obligation to offer a FAPE to J.W. simply because he is not currently (and never was)\n\nenrolled in a DCPS school. In fact, plaintiff\u2019s own Exhibit to its written objections supports the\n\nopposite conclusion:\n\n                Question B-8: What are the LEA\u2019s responsibilities for reevaluations of\n                parentally placed children?\n\n                Answer: The LEA where the private elementary school or secondary\n                school is located is responsible for conducting reevaluations of children\n                with disabilities enrolled by their parents in the private elementary and\n                secondary schools located in the LEA.\n\nEx. 2 to Pl.\u2019s Object. at 7.\n\n        The separate statutory framework also does not create an exception to the requirement\n\nthat plaintiff develop an IEP for J.W. As plaintiff itself notes, an IEP is defined as including \u201ca\n\n\u2018statement of the special education and related services\u2019 to be provided to the child.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot.\n\nat 8, quoting 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d). Put differently, an IEP is a written statement of the services\n\nthat will be provided to the child should his or her parent(s) accept the offer of a FAPE: at the\n\n(re)evaluation stage, it puts a child\u2019s parent(s) on notice of what the FAPE would entail.\n\nDeveloping an IEP is therefore a necessary predicate to offering a FAPE, and it follows that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fobligation to offer a FAPE also includes an obligation to develop an IEP. 4 Cf. Forest Grove Sch.\n\nDist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 238\u201339 (2009) (\u201c[W]hen a child requires special-education services,\n\na school district\u2019s failure to propose an IEP of any kind is at least as serious a violation of its\n\nresponsibilities under IDEA as a failure to provide an adequate IEP.\u201d); Vinyard, 2013 WL\n\n5302674, at *7\u20139, citing I.H. ex rel. D.S. v. Cumberland Valley Sch. Dist., 842 F. Supp. 2d 762,\n\n772 (M.D. Pa. 2012). So, as there is no requirement that a child be currently enrolled in a public\n\nschool to be entitled to a FAPE offer, similarly there is no requirement that the child be currently\n\nenrolled in a public school in order to trigger the LEA\u2019s obligation to develop an IEP for that\n\nchild. See Woods v. Northport Pub. Sch., 487 Fed. App\u2019x 968, 979\u201380 (6th Cir. 2012), quoting\n\nJames ex rel. James v. Upper Arlington City Sch. Dist., 228 F.3d 764, 768 (6th Cir. 2000) (\u201cTo\n\nhold otherwise would allow the school to slough off any response to its duty until the parents\n\neither performed the futile act of enrolling their son for one day and then withdrawing him as\n\nsoon as the IEP was complete, or, worse, leaving the child in an arguably inadequate program for\n\na year just to re-establish his legal rights.\u201d); District of Columbia v. Abramson, 493 F. Supp. 2d\n\n80, 85 (D.D.C. 2007), quoting Hr\u2019g Officer Decision at 8 (affirming the HOD, which found that\n\n\u201c[t]he LEA is still required to offer a FAPE to any resident when there is a parent request for the\n\n\n\n4       The fact that the U.S. Department of Education has stated that a \u201cpublic agency is not\nrequired to develop an IEP when the parent refuses to consent to the initial provision of special\neducation and related services\u201d does not alter the conclusion that plaintiff must develop an IEP\nfor J.W. Subpart D\u2014Evaluations, Eligibility Determinations, Individual Education Programs,\nand Educational Placements, USDOE, http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/,root,regs,preamble2,\nprepart2,D (last visited Jan. 15, 2014). The USDOE quote refers to situations where a parent\nmanifests his or her intent to deny consent for the actual provision of special education and\nrelated services to the child; it does not relate to a situation \u2013 like the one in this case \u2013 where a\nparent consents to the development of a FAPE offer and requests additional information\nregarding what that offer will include while reserving the judgment on whether the FAPE offer\nwill ultimately be accepted. See Vinyard, 2013 WL 5302674, at *9 (explaining that \u201cthe relevant\ninquiry is whether the parents expressed their intent to maintain the child\u2019s private school\nenrollment after the school district offers a FAPE\u201d).\n                                                  8\n\fstudent to be evaluated\u201d and that offering a FAPE includes, among other things, \u201cdetermining\n\neligibility [for services, and] developing an IEP if the student is eligible\u201d); see also Vinyard,\n\n2013 WL 5302674, at *8\u20139 (collecting cases).\n\n       This conclusion is consistent with the statutory framework that governs parentally placed\n\nprivate school students. 5 As plaintiff\u2019s written objections indicate, its arguments focus on the\n\n\u201cschool system\u2019s responsibility to provide \u2018special education and related services,\u2019 which\n\ncomprise both a FAPE and an IEP.\u201d          Pl.\u2019s Object. at 13 (emphasis added).      But merely\n\ndeveloping an IEP to inform a child\u2019s parent(s) about the services that could be offered in an\n\neffort to provide that student with a FAPE is not the same thing as requiring the LEA to actually\n\nprovide the services described in the IEP. As a result, the development of an IEP does not\n\nimplicate the limitations of section 1412(a)(10) or section 300.147(a), and there is no statutory\n\nbasis to require that the child enroll in a public school before the IEP is developed. 6 See\n\nVinyard, 2013 WL 5302674, at *7\u20138. Plaintiff therefore has not met its burden to establish that\n\nthe HOD was wrong and that, under the IDEA, it is not obligated to develop an IEP for J.W. 7\n\n\n\n5       Because the separate statutory framework governing parentally placed private school\nstudents is irrelevant to this case, it follows that the statutory provision governing children who\nare placed in private schools by a LEA also has no bearing on the inquiry here. The Court\ntherefore rejects plaintiff\u2019s argument that relies on the language in the provision dealing with\nstudents who are placed in private school by a LEA. See Pl.\u2019s Object. at 13 n.6.\n\n6       Because this case does not involve a dispute over whether services must be provided\nwhile J.W. remains enrolled in a private school and instead focuses on plaintiff\u2019s ongoing\nobligation to make a FAPE available to J.W., the cases relied on by plaintiff \u2013 Board of\nEducation v. Johnson, 543 F. Supp. 2d 351 (D. Del. 2008), and D.L. ex rel. K.L. v. Baltimore\nBoard of School Commissioners, 706 F.3d 256 (4th Cir. 2013) \u2013 offer no guidance here.\n\n7       Plaintiff argues that 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.148, which governs tuition reimbursement after a\ndenial of a FAPE, supports its theory that it need not provide J.W. with an IEP until he enrolls in\na public school. Pl.\u2019s Object. at 17\u201318. But this argument fails for the same reason as plaintiff\u2019s\nmain point: it focuses on the District\u2019s responsibility to provide a FAPE, instead of focusing on\nwhat is actually at issue here \u2013 the District\u2019s obligation to offer a FAPE.\n                                                9\n\f       Plaintiff\u2019s Spending Clause argument does not warrant a contrary conclusion.                As\n\nmentioned above, the IDEA creates a basic requirement that a LEA offer a FAPE to all children\n\nwith disabilities residing in the LEA\u2019s district. There is no exception to this requirement simply\n\nbecause a child is currently enrolled in a private school. Thus, plaintiff has not raised a valid\n\nSpending Clause concern because Congress has unambiguously required plaintiff to offer a\n\nFAPE \u2013 which includes the development of an IEP \u2013 to J.W. because his parents have requested\n\na reevaluation, he is a resident of the District of Columbia, and he is a student with a disability.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the Court\u2019s review of the Administrative Record, the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report\n\nand Recommendation, plaintiff\u2019s objections, and defendant\u2019s response to these objections, the\n\nCourt will adopt the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation. The Court will therefore\n\ndeny plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and grant defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                               AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                               United States District Judge\n\nDATE: January 16, 2014\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f",

    "on the Spectrum.\n\n## Contents\n\nCraash was a monthly publication containing game reviews and previews, news, competitions, coder interviews and articles about various aspects of computer programming and games design (including an introductory section for beginners). It also published listings for many popular ZX Spectrum games. Later issues included coverage of other home computers such as the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Acorn Electron.\n\nThe magazine was well-known for its often controversial artwork, especially in its earlier years. Oliver Frey (who went on to do similar work for magazines like Sinclair User) drew many of the covers with a distinctive style which led to accusations that it was not original enough.^{[1]} The covers were also notable for their frequent depiction of female nudity and sexually explicit scenes, such as a centrefold featuring a woman's breasts in Issue 20 (April 1986).^{[2]}^{[3]} Some readers took exception to the art, which was seen by some as too risqu\u00e9.^{[4]}\n\nIn one incident in May 1985, Frey drew an illustration of a naked woman with her legs apart on the cover for Issue 30. This sparked outrage among parents and a subsequent protest by members of the Christian Association Against Pornography (CAAP).^{[5]}^{[6]} The editor-in-chief at the time, John Lacey, defended the image in the magazine as \"tasteful\". CAAP member Peter Tickner claimed that he would not allow his children to read the publication and suggested a boycott of advertisers. A subsequent editorial in Issue 31 stated that although the cover art was tasteful it may have been too much for some readers, but that they could choose to turn over the page.^{[7]} In May 1986 the magazine ran a competition where the prize winner would be invited to pose nude for the front cover of an upcoming issue. The idea proved popular with readers;^{[8]}^{[9]} however, there were calls from various groups to boycott the publication after it was announced.^{[10]} In August 1986, CAAP wrote a letter to Crash's publisher Newsfield Publications complaining about the competition and claiming that they had received complaints from parents. They also suggested that Newsfield should provide \"clear guidance\" on what children were allowed to read.^{[11]}\n\nIn Issue 32 (July 1986), a letter in response to this controversy stated:^{[12]}\n\n> The letters page has been invaded by people who don't know the first thing about taste, decency and good judgement. I feel sorry for these people; they must be really boring at parties! It is not Crash that is pornographic or obscene but those of you who read into it what isn't there.\n>\n> \u2014 \n\nA further controversy occurred when the magazine published a competition in Issue 36 (January 1987) whereby readers could send in their own drawings to be judged by Frey, who would choose three of them to appear on future covers. The contest received more than a thousand entries from young artists.^{[13]} Some were upset that the winning entry was a cartoon depicting an apparently drunken policeman being assaulted by an elephant and two giraffes. In response, Frey stated:^{[14]}^{[15]}\n\n> The winner is entitled to his opinion of me as well. I don't want people who like the same kind of art as me \u2013 that would be boring! My aim has always been to annoy and shock a few people with my work, but not enough to cause offence ... I think it's a shame that some readers have been shocked by what they consider indecent.\n>\n> \u2014 \n\nFrey left the magazine in 1987 after being involved in an incident where he assaulted his girlfriend.^{[16]} He was succeeded as illustrator by Richard Wainwright, who continued to draw sexually explicit covers for the magazine until it closed down.\n\n## History and demise\n\nCrash was published monthly from its launch on 28 February 1984^{[17]} by Newsfield Publications Ltd in Leeds, England, a company founded by John Lacey, Richard Stoneman and Alan Norbury. The publication was an immediate success, selling over 50,000 copies during the first three months of its life.^{[18",

This week\u2019s targets are as follows:\n\nNaaked-Eye: Saturn\u2019s Rings\nBinoculars: Messier Object M64 (Virgo) and M95/M96 (Leo)\nTelescope: NGC 7686 (Cassiopeia)\n\nSky Map\n\n## Comments\n\nApril 12, 2013 at 7:36 pm\n\nI am new to this hobby and I really appreciate these podcasts. This week, when trying to find M95/M96 in Leo, it seemed as though the two galaxies were one object (although there was a clear space between them). Is this normal? Also, does one galaxy appear bigger than the other because of their distance from us or is there another reason?\nJulie\n\nApril 13, 2013 at 6:47 am\n\nThanks for your question! The two galaxies are indeed separate objects. But you may be able to see them as one object in a small telescope because they are so close together. You can also look up NGC 3598 which is a galaxy between M95 and M96, and you'll see that all three of these galaxies lie along the same line of sight from Earth, but each of them are millions of light-years away in different directions.\nAnother thing to note about these galaxies: they can be quite faint, especially with a small telescope or binoculars! They may require good sky conditions to see them well at all. But if you have a dark enough sky and the weather cooperates, you should definitely get a chance to observe them!\nBest of luck on your observing adventures!",

    "s study aimed at identifying the association between PHKG1 g.8283C>A variant and several meat quality traits. The data set was obtained from 97 Large White pig lines selected in the last three years in the Pig Research Center (CREP) of Udine, Italy. Animals were slaughtered at approximately 40 weeks old with an average carcass weight equal to 135 kg and 8 pigs per line were sampled for meat quality analysis. PHKG1 g.8283C>A variant was determined by PCR-RFLP using EcoRV restriction enzyme on genomic DNA extracted from ear tissue samples, and the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test confirmed the normal distribution of this polymorphism in our population. Statistical analysis showed that PHKG1 g.8283C>A variant was associated with meat color parameters: L* value at 45 minutes postmortem (p<0.05), and also a.L* ratio and hue angle values at 24 hours postmortem were significantly different between genotypes (p<0.01). The interaction between g.8283C>A variant and line of origin was found to be significant for L, and HUE color parameters (p<0.05), while the interaction with slaughterhouse was not statistically relevant (p=ns). This work suggests that PHKG1 g.8283C>A is a candidate marker for meat quality traits in Large White pig lines, but it must be considered as one of several polymorphisms affecting these traits in the whole population.\nPublished on: August 16th, 2019",

    "differences between the print and the digital versions. Here is a list of those pages for this article:\n\nThe only person who knew he was going to be hanged today was Clifford Olson, but not even his family knew until yesterday morning that he would die at 10 A.M., 28 years after kidnapping and killing his first victim in British Columbia.\n\nHis death will close one of the most sensational chapters in Canadian crime history - a serial killer who took 11 victims, seven of them children.\n\nMr. Olson was not sentenced to die until yesterday morning, when the Supreme Court of Canada rejected his final appeal. He had exhausted every other means of stopping the death sentence imposed by lower courts and by juries. The only people in Canada with authority over a capital case are the Supreme Court and Gov. Gen. Jeanne Sauve.\n\nThe decision to hang Mr. Olson was announced at 9:45 A.M., an hour before his execution, after a special hearing of the court on Friday morning. The decision was delivered by Justice John Major in a two-page statement that concluded with the words \"This appeal is dismissed.\"\n\nThere had been no hint that the court would issue a judgment this week, much less so quickly. But Mr. Olson's lawyer said yesterday he had received word on Friday afternoon of the decision and immediately called the court to ask for the reasons in writing. He got them late Saturday night and passed them along early yesterday morning to his client, who was taken by car from his cell at B.C. Penitentiary to the execution chamber nearby.\n\nAsked how he felt when the verdict came down, Mr. Olson said: \"I guess I'm not a very emotional person.\" Asked if he had any last words for anyone, he replied: \"No comment,\" and asked that his lawyer be present at his death to see it done right.\n\nMr. Olson, 51 years old, was executed by hanging in a small room behind the execution chamber at B.C. Penitentiary with no witnesses other than the executioner, two prison officials and his lawyer, Terry LaPlante. He had been given an hour to make his peace with God before being blindfolded, tied to the scaffold, hooded and strangled for 10 minutes by a man whose name will never be known or published in Canada.\n\nHis death was kept secret until 3 P.M., when prison officials announced that he had been hanged \"without incident\" at 10 A.M.\n\nThe Supreme Court had granted Mr. Olson leave to appeal on Friday after a hearing of the court by telephone from Vancouver, where Mr. Olson has spent most of his time since his conviction in May 1987 for seven murders and two attempted murders. The other four victims were not counted because they died before he was caught.\n\nThe final decision to hang him came only hours after the court's ruling. \"I understand that there are still some people who think I didn't do it, but you have got to look at what happened,\" Mr. Olson said as he sat in his cell on Friday morning waiting for word from the court.\n\n\"If you don't believe me, that's your business. But the evidence is all there.\"\n\nMr. Olson was one of Canada's most notorious criminals and his name has become a byword among many Canadians for the depravity of human behavior. The police found bodies in trunks, freezers, caves and graves. One child victim had been buried in the yard at Mr. Olson's home on Saltspring Island, 100 miles southwest of Vancouver.\n\n\"I wish to God I could turn back the clock,\" he said as his final appeal was being decided. \"But you can't change what happened.\"\n\nHe added: \"I guess it is up to people to decide whether they want to execute me or not, but I am sorry for what has happened and I don't think there is any excuse for what I have done.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling was a surprise because the court had turned down Mr. Olson's previous appeals without hearing him on his final appeal in April 1987. The reason then was that the court decided it could not grant Mr. Olson leave to appeal unless he had exhausted all possible means of stopping his execution.\n\nThe British Columbia government and a B.C. judge said the sentence must be carried out immediately after the jury convicted him, but the Supreme Court ruled in January 1987 that there was still time for",

If someone falls behind on their payments, the payroll company can get that taken care of for you.\n\nWhen you do your own payroll processing, you have to spend time every week or month updating employee information in the software or paper-based system that you use. You also have to update all of that information with the benefits plans that you offer. When you outsource to a good payroll services company, they keep track of it all for you. You don\u2019t even have to tell them anything about your employees other than when they get paid and where to send their paychecks.\n\nOutsourcing means that you don\u2019t have to worry about doing any of those things. Your payroll company does all the work and lets you know if something needs correcting. If you hire someone just to do your payroll, you\u2019ll be responsible for paying their salary and benefits as well as their vacation time and sick days.\n\nWith a payroll service, that\u2019s all taken care of for you and it is included in the price that you pay. When you outsource your payroll services, you are getting a highly experienced person to do it. These services have been doing nothing but payroll processing for businesses of all sizes for years, so you can be sure that they know what they are doing.\n\n### Payroll Service Company\n\nPayroll is one of the most time-consuming tasks any small business owner will have to deal with. About one out of every three businesses pays a penalty each year for mistaken payroll tax reporting.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be one of those businesses, which is why outsourcing to a reliable payroll services makes sense. There are many benefits to outsourcing your payroll to the right service. Outsourcing gives you one less responsibility and that\u2019s usually well worth the money that you spend. You also don\u2019t have to pay for an accountant or in-house payroll expert. The amount of time and effort you will save is just too great to overlook the option of outsourcing your payroll services.\n\nWhen you do your own payroll, you are responsible for getting the deductions correct and filing the proper paperwork with the government.

We have to show that the\nresult is actually a diagram. The proof will be inductive: we will\nfirst verify this when there are only finitely many diagrams\n$\\rde_{i}$ and then use the axiom of dependent choice (AD) to lift this\nto an arbitrary family of diagrams.\n\n\\begin{definition}\n  \\label{defn:diagrams-of-diagrams}\n  Given a family of diagrams $\\rde_{i}$, we will write $\\prod\\limits_i\n  \\rde_{i}$ for the diagram whose object is the product\n  $\\prod\\limits_i X_{i}$ and whose morphisms are $f_{i}$ defined as follows:\n  \\[\n    \\prod\\nolimits_i X_{i}\n      \\mathrel{\n        \\xymatrix@1@!C@C=2.5em@M@R=0.5ex{ @^{<~}{}>{\\mbox{${f_{i}}$}} }@/^4pc/@|!\n          {>{}>}{X_{i}}\\,.\n  \\]\n  Here the $f_{i}$ are morphisms of the $\\rde_{i}$ which form a family\n  indexed by $i$, and we will assume that for every diagram $\\rde$ in\n  this family there is an index $j$ such that $f_{i} \\cong\n  f_{j}$.\n\\end{definition}\n\nIn general, $\\prod\\nolimits_i X_{i}$ might not be the product of the $X_{i}$\nas it should be if this were to make sense. For example, given a family\nof sets $(A_{i})$, the cartesian product of the $A_{i}$ is the\nset-theoretic product $\\prod A_{i} = \\{f : \\mathop{\\mathrm{dom}} f =\n  \\{i : A_{i}\\neq\\varnothing\\} : \\mathop{\\mathrm{cod}} f = \\bigcup_i\n  A_{i}\\}$, while in the context of diagrams, we want a family of\nmorphisms $(f_{i})$ to be represented by their domain. It is easy to\nsee that if we assume $X_{i} \\neq\\varnothing$, then $\\prod\\nolimits_i X_{i}$\nis indeed the cartesian product.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n  \\label{lem:product-of-diagrams-are-diagrams}\n  Let $(\\rde_{i})$ be a family of diagrams such that, for any diagram\n  $\\rde$, there is an index $j$ such that $\\rde$ and $\\rde_{j}$ are\n  isomorphic. Then $\\prod\\nolimits_i \\rde_{i}$ is a diagram.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\n  Let us first show the lemma in the special case when there are only\n  finitely many diagrams. In this case, we have $i = 1$ or $2$, and so\n  the family $(\\rde_{i})$ is either empty or has only one element,\n  say $\\rde_1$. Therefore, $\\prod\\nolimits_i \\rde_i$ is isomorphic to\n  $\\rde_1$ (when there are no diagrams, then we take $\\rde_1$\n  vacuously to be $\\mathsf{Id}_{\\varnothing}$), and so $\\prod\\nolimits_i \\rde_i$ is\n  indeed a diagram.\n  \n  Let us now lift this case to an arbitrary family of diagrams $(\\rde_i)$ using AD. The key to the argument will be the following observation: given a diagram $\\rde$, if there is an index $j$ such that $\\rde$ and $\\rde_j$ are isomorphic, then $\\rde = \\rde_{\\ell}$ for some $\\ell$. To see this, suppose we have an index $k$ such that $\\rde \\cong \\rde_k$, where we know by assumption that there exists an index $j$ such that $\\rde_j \\cong \\rde$.

    "and religious groups were able to influence a major shift in sexual education. Abstinence-only sex ed replaced the comprehensive curriculum that was more widely implemented in schools and provided information about birth control, sexual orientation and relationships. However, despite the lack of sex-ed funding from the government, states that still offer sex ed programs, like California, have been incorporating the LGBTQ community into their lesson plans since 2011 (Eskridge 1).\n\nIn the United States, the first week in April is recognized as \u201cGay and Lesbian Awareness Week\u201d which is an event that highlights the social issues LGBTQ people face daily. In 1996, then-President Clinton recognized April as National Gay and Lesbian Awareness Month to support equal rights for all Americans. For nearly a century, queer culture has been suppressed by mainstream society. The Stonewall riots in New York City, New York on June 28th, 1969 started the gay liberation movement that brought gay culture into the light. The Stonewall riots began as a response to police raiding an underground gay club. The raids were seen as an affront to LGBTQ pride and a demonstration against discrimination. The rioting led to marches and protests that lasted for the following five days, making Stonewall the catalyst of the gay liberation movement and paving the way for a more inclusive sexual education program in the United States.\n\nThere are currently 29 states and the District of Columbia that include some form of LGBTQ content in their sexual education programs. Most states are now teaching comprehensive sex-ed programs about STDs and STIs, as well as birth control, gender identity and relationships. There are also some states, like Texas, that are still using abstinence-only curriculums (Eskridge 1). The Human Rights Campaign has created a resource for youth titled \u201cTeaching Respect: LGBT Inclusion in Schools,\u201d to help teachers, school staff and parents with LGBTQ-inclusive sex education (Human Rights Campaign 1).\n\nWith the increase in sexual education programs that are becoming more inclusive of the LGBTQ community, schools can expect to see fewer cases of bullying among their students. The number one predictor of how well a student will perform in school is whether or not they feel safe, respected and free from harm at school (Human Rights Campaign 1). Inclusive sex education can help foster an environment where all students feel valued and respected. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, teaching children about LGBTQ people, gender identity and sexual orientation at a young age can help prevent bullying in the future (American Academy of Pediatrics 1).\n\n## References\n\n\u2022 Eskridge, Sarah. \u201cSex education needs LGBT curriculum.\u201d The Daily Evergreen.

But Hodges could be found this week at his barber shop, giving haircuts and doling out advice about how to help a community devastated by Superstorm Sandy.\n\nOn Tuesday, he was one of several people who showed up to accept the delivery of Red Cross supplies \u2013 food, water, blankets, tarps \u2013 from the shelter at the Martin Luther King Community Center in Hempstead, N.Y. The supplies will go to Pinetown residents who are staying at the community center or are picking them up for those still trying to deal with the storm\u2019s destruction.\n\nHodges\u2019 Pinetown neighborhood is located in the part of Long Island that was hardest hit by Superstorm Sandy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people know how hard this part of Long Island was hit,\u201d said Hodges, whose shop had just reopened. He said his barber shop has a reputation for giving good haircuts and good advice.\n\n\u201cPeople know they can come in here and ask me what\u2019s going on with the recovery or where to go to get help,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re back up and running. I have my gas turned back on and I am going to make a point of doing what I can to help Pinetown. People are hurting and need supplies, food and blankets.\u201d\n\nThe Martin Luther King Community Center is a large, three-story building that was converted into a Red Cross shelter after the storm. The second floor houses those staying in the shelter while the first floor serves as distribution point for supplies that have come from other parts of the country.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, people were picking up the supplies and heading home to Pinetown. Hodges and others who arrived with him had come from his neighborhood, said Hodges, who is working closely with the Red Cross on plans to help Pinetown recover from the storm.\n\nThe Martin Luther King Community Center was converted into a Red Cross shelter after Superstorm Sandy struck. The first floor serves as a distribution point for supplies that have been sent from other parts of the country.\n\nOne resident said the recovery has been tough for her neighborhood and there is a lot more to do than the supplies delivered by the Red Cross on Tuesday. \u201cI am thankful, but we are going to need a lot more,\u201d said the woman, who asked not be named.\n\n\u201cWe just want to get back to where we were before Superstorm Sandy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really miss our community center and our neighborhood. There was a lot of damage, but I think we are going to make it.\u201d\n\nThe Martin Luther King Community Center shelter will close on Sunday night. The Red Cross is now looking for other facilities that can help deliver supplies in the Pinetown area.\n\nAs for Hodges, he said there is always a need for people to help their neighborhoods after natural disasters like Superstorm Sandy and to look out for those who are less fortunate. And it\u2019s his philosophy that people can\u2019t give up on their neighborhoods when they are hit hard by storms.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look the other way when you have friends and neighbors hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was at the shelter today.\u201d",

    "ched end of the crowbar cannot be inserted between adjacent studs in walls, or between rafter and ceiling boards, or between roof boards and roof sheathing without first removing the fasteners such as nails or staples which hold such components in position; otherwise, there is a risk of damaging the fasteners. Secondly, if a long pry bar were to be used for prying up the fasteners from a narrow area in order to insert the end of the bar under the edge of a roof sheathing, it would be necessary to carry out the removal process with one hand while using another hand to steady the heavy weight and prevent it from falling and hitting someone. Thirdly, if the fasteners are removed from the narrow space between the wall studs or ceiling rafter, and the crowbar is then inserted at an angle from outside the house in an attempt to pry up a sheathing board nailed to the rafter or to pull out a nail embedded in the bottom of a floor board, it would be impossible for one man to steady the heavy crowbar and push or pull it simultaneously. The above mentioned difficulties are further exacerbated by the need to hold the heavy crowbar with one hand while using another hand to guide its point into position for prying. Moreover, conventional crowbars are not long enough to reach from an outside area of a house into the narrow space under a wall sheathing and into the narrow gap between a floor board and ceiling rafter.\nThe above-mentioned difficulties with the conventional pry bar may be overcome by inserting the point of a crowbar under the edge of a wall sheathing or floor board in order to wedge out the fasteners from a wider area. This requires that the crowbar has a relatively long pointed end to fit snugly against the bottom surface of the fasteners so that they can be pulled out as the bar is pulled. However, it is a disadvantage of using a long crowbar with a long and pointed tip that it becomes difficult to insert the point into a narrow space under a sheathing board or between a floor board and rafter.\nMoreover, since a conventional pry bar must always be inserted at an angle when trying to pull out a fastener from a wall or roof, there is an ever-present danger of the bar slipping off and falling down. There is therefore a need to invent a pry bar which has the flexibility to allow the bar to be inserted into a narrow space with its pointed end lying flat in alignment with the bottom surface of the fasteners.\nMoreover, although conventional pry bars may be used to remove nails from floor boards or wall sheathing, there is always the danger that they may be dropped accidentally and strike a person. Moreover, the end of the bar becomes quickly damaged if it is used for removing nails. This limits the length of time for which the bar can be used effectively.\nIt has also been found to be advantageous to be able to use the same lever bar not only as a pry bar but also as a hammer when there are no fasteners present or as a tool with which to pound a spike into the ground, or as a maul for pounding and driving nails or screws. Conventional crowbars are not long enough to permit them to be used as hammers or to drive spikes.\nConventional crowbars have also been found to lack flexibility in that they cannot be used for prying up floor boards, or sheathing boards nailed to rafter, or wall boards nailed to studs. They do not have the necessary length to reach into a narrow space between a ceiling and floor or between wall sheathing and wall studs.\nAccordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved lever bar which is long enough to be used for prying up floor boards or roof shingles nailed to rafter, or wall boards nailed to studs; and at the same time can be used as a hammer or a maul when there are no fasteners.\nA further object of the invention is to provide such a tool having an extended length which allows it to be used as a hammer or a maul without bending.\nAn additional object of the invention is to provide such a tool having sufficient flexibility to allow it to be used for prying up fasteners from the narrow spaces under a wall sheathing or roof board or between a floor and rafter, and to allow it to fit snugly against the bottom surface of the fastener so that they can be pulled out.\nA still further object of the invention is to provide such a tool having a flat end which will not damage fasteners such as nails or staples used to hold components of houses in place.\nOther objects and advantages will become apparent from the description set forth below.\nTo the accomplishment of the foregoing and related objects, this invention relates to a lever bar comprising a rigid bar adapted to fit snugly against the bottom surface of fasteners such as nails, and being flexible at least to allow its pointed end to be inserted into narrow spaces.",
    "are two types of non conductive safety floor mats available:\n\n1. Conductive Mats \u2013 These have a carbonized rubber surface that will allow the electricity to flow through it into the ground in case of an accidental electric shock or short circuit. They also provide anti-fatigue properties for workers who stand on them all day long while working at their desks or workstations near power supplies such as computers, printers etc., which can cause discomfort if they are not protected by a mat made from conductive material like this one does!\n2. Non Conductive Mats \u2013 These have no carbonized rubber surface so there is no risk of electrocution when someone steps onto them accidentally during an emergency situation where electricity has been shut off due to safety reasons (i.e., fire). However, these types do not offer any anti-fatigue benefits either since they don\u2019t conduct current through themselves into grounding points below floor level like their counterparts above would do instead; however if you want something more durable than just regular carpet tiles then perhaps consider purchasing some sort of rubberized material instead?\n\n## What is the difference between a non-conductive safety mat and an anti-fatigue mat?\n\nNon conductive mats are made from materials that will not conduct electricity. They can be used in areas where there is no risk of electric shock, such as near power supplies or electrical boxes. Anti fatigue mats on the other hand are designed to reduce stress on your feet and legs by providing a cushioning surface for you to stand on while working at your desk all day long!\n\n## What types of materials can be used in non-conductive safety floor mats?\n\nNon conductive safety floor mats, also called switchboard matting is designed to protect people from the dangers of electric shock in high voltage environments located in educational buildings. It\u2019s recommended that you use this type of mat around power supplies and electrical boxes as well as other areas where there may be a risk for electrocution or short circuits due to an accidental discharge (i.e., fire).\n\nThere are two types available: conductive mats which have carbonized rubber surfaces so they allow electricity flow through them into grounding points below floor level; non-conductive ones do not offer any anti fatigue benefits but instead provide protection against electrocution should someone step onto one accidentally during an emergency situation where power has been shut off due to safety reasons (i.e., fire).\n\n## How can you tell if a mat is conductive or non-conductive?\n\nYou can tell by looking at the material used in its construction and whether it has any carbonized rubber surface on top of that layer which will allow electricity flow through them into grounding points below floor level. If there isn\u2019t one then this means they are not conductive mats but instead non-conductive ones so do not offer anti fatigue benefits either since these types don\u2019t conduct current through themselves into grounding points below floor level like their counterparts above would do instead; however if you want something more durable than just regular carpet tiles then perhaps consider purchasing some sort of rubberized material instead?\n\n## What are the benefits of using non-conductive safety mats in educational buildings?\n\nNon conductive safety mats, also called switchboard matting is designed to protect people from the dangers of electric shock in high voltage environments located in educational buildings.

When the ball hits the wall, it bounces off but doesn't move away from the wall like normal Pong.\nI have tried to set the restitution for both bodies to 1.0 (the default is 0.2) with no success. I would like to know how to make collision detection work properly in Box2D using Citrus Engine. Thanks!\n\nA:\n\nYou need to create a custom CollisionListener and add it to your World instance :\n`world.setCollisionListener(new MyCustomCollisionListener());`\nIn this listener, you can check the collisions between bodies (or shapes) and react accordingly.",

I'm not sure how much of this has been discussed, but \nhere are some thoughts about why we should be proud of being associated with \nEnron:\n\n1) Enron is one of the most innovative companies in America today. It was \nfounded by a Wharton grad (Ken Lay), and it's CEO is also from Wharton (Jeff \nSkilling). In addition, many other executives at Enron are graduates of our \nschool. I believe that we should be proud to have such an innovative company as \na strong supporter of the school.\n\n2) Enron has been one of the most generous donors to Wharton in recent years. \nIt's support for the new building is a prime example. We should be thankful that \nwe are getting this type of support from such an innovative company. I think it \nis important for us as students to remember this, especially since we have all \nbenefited from Enron's generosity in recent years (the new building is a prime \nexample).\n\n3) Enron has been one of the best employers of Wharton graduates. I know that \nmany people who are currently working at Enron, and they love it there. They \nhave said that Enron provides an excellent work environment for MBAs (I'm not \nsure if this is true or not). However, what I do know is that many Wharton \ngraduates have been very happy with their decision to join the company after \ngraduation. In addition, it has hired more than a few of our classmates from WG02 \nthis year. Again, this is something for which we should be proud and thankful.\n\n4) Enron is one of the most forward-thinking companies in America today. It was \none of the first companies to really push the concept of \"deregulation\" on a \nnational scale. In addition, it has been an advocate for other types of reforms \nin recent years (such as social security). I think that this is something we can \nbe proud of as well. We should be happy that our school is associated with such \na forward-thinking company.\n\n5) Enron is a great place to work for MBAs. As mentioned above, many people have \nsaid they love working there. In addition, it provides excellent opportunities \nfor career growth and advancement (I'm not sure if this is true or not). However, \nwhat I do know is that many Wharton graduates have been very happy with their \ndecision to join the company after graduation.

Again, this is something for \nwhich we can all be proud.\n\n7) Enron has been very supportive of Wharton in recent years (the new building is \na prime example). We should remember that they have given us so much over the \nyears, and it's important to recognize this fact as well!

Then we looked for a tool that would meet all our expectations, both technically as well as from an aesthetic point of view.\n\nOnce selected the virtual tools that best suited us, we started working on them: Moodle and Blog. We developed content according to what had been agreed in previous meetings with teachers and parents. This part has been one of the most important because it was necessary to develop a material adapted to each group and at the same time be useful for both.\n\nFinally, we have done some tests before publishing our work, to make sure that everything worked properly and also asked the opinion of other people who had not participated in the project so far. In this way, they could give us their opinions about what we had developed. This helped us improve certain aspects or add new content.\n\nThe video shows how the virtual environment is composed: Moodle for teachers and Blog for parents. We have chosen these tools because of its ease of use and accessibility to both groups. The main objective was that all people involved in this project, whether they are students, teachers or families could understand what we wanted to convey.\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\nDuring the development of our virtual environment, we have learned many things: how to work with Moodle and Blog; How to use different resources such as videos, podcasts, images, etc..; How to develop content for both teachers and parents according to their needs. We also had to consider other aspects such as accessibility or usability when creating our virtual environment.\n\nOne of the most important things we have learned is how to work in a team: everyone has contributed ideas, suggestions and opinions that have helped improve our project. In addition, it was very interesting working with people from different backgrounds because each one had its own way of seeing things which enriched us all.",

There are several known risk factors for AF, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease, sleep apnea, alcohol use, and smoking.\n\nIn this issue of Cardiology, Drs Kwok et al discuss the role of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in AF development. They highlight a number of studies that have demonstrated an association between OSA and increased risk for AF as well as recurrence after ablation. The authors also provide data from several trials showing improvement in atrial arrhythmias with continuous positive airway pressure therapy, which is the mainstay treatment for patients with OSA.\n\nIn this issue of Cardiology, Drs Kwok et al discuss the role of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in AF development.

The authors also provide data from several trials showing improvement in atrial arrhythmias with continuous positive airway pressure therapy, which is the mainstay treatment for patients with OSA.\n\nAs a result of this review article by Drs Kwok et al, I hope that clinicians will consider screening their AF patients for OSA and treating them accordingly to prevent recurrence of arrhythmias as well as reduce other cardiovascular risk factors associated with the disease. It is also important to note that OSA has been linked to increased incidence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Therefore, screening for this condition in patients who have any one or more of these conditions would be beneficial as well.\n\nIn addition to the review article by Drs Kwok et al, we are pleased to present several other excellent articles on AF in this issue of Cardiology. The first is a case report from Drs Gao and Zhang who describe a patient with paroxysmal AF that was successfully treated using an endocardial ablation approach after the failure of two transseptal approaches. This interesting case highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism behind arrhythmias in order to determine which technique would be most appropriate for treatment.\n\nThe second article is a review by Drs Kang et al on the role of AF ablation and left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) in patients with nonvalvular AF. The authors discuss how LAAC can reduce the risk of stroke in this population as well as improve survival rates when compared to warfarin administration alone. They also review studies that have shown a decrease in arrhythmia recurrence after ablation among patients who underwent concomitant LAAC during their procedure versus those who did not receive closure at all or only received an endocardial approach without any additional procedures performed on the left atrial appendage (LAA).\n\nThe third article is a review by Drs Zhang et al that discusses how AF ablation can improve outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure. The authors highlight several studies showing improved survival rates among those who underwent catheter ablation versus medical therapy alone, as well as decreased hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbations after the procedure was performed. They also review data from trials that have shown an improvement in quality of life scores following successful treatment with this technique when compared to patients receiving only pharmacologic agents or no intervention at all.\n\nThe fourth article is a case report by Drs Kwok et al who describe how they treated two different types of AF using endocardial ablation techniques, including cryoablation and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). The authors highlight the importance of understanding which type of arrhythmia each patient has before choosing an appropriate treatment method for them.

    "To maximize the amount of energy your antenna receives, you'd ideally want to position it such that it has a clear view of the transmitting antenna. This is because radio waves, like all forms of electromagnetic radiation, radiate equally in all directions. So, the best way to increase the signal your antenna receives is to point it towards the transmitting antenna, much like how a satellite dish does. \n\nYou'd also want to consider the length of the antenna. For AM radio, the antenna should be a quarter or half of the wavelength of the radio signal. The wavelength is a characteristic of the radio station's transmission, so you can't just pick any length. A good starting point for the antenna length would be 100 inches or 8.3 feet for the half-wavelength and 50 inches or 4.4 feet for a quarter wavelength. \n\nThe material of the antenna itself is also important. Copper is a great conductor and a good choice for receiving antennas.\n\nLastly, the surrounding environment matters too. Metal objects and multi-story buildings can interfere with the radio waves and diminish the signal your antenna receives. So, if possible, try to position your antenna away from such obstructions. \n\nRemember, radio wave propagation can be quite tricky, and real-world conditions can vary widely from idealized situations, so you might have to experiment with the positioning and setup to maximize your antenna's reception.",

    "signals R', G' and B' by the digital processing unit. The three primary color data R', G' and B' are then converted into the three secondary color signals R\", G\" and B\" by the color management system. Finally, the three secondary color signals R\", G\" and B\" are converted into the three secondary color data R\", G\" and B\" by the digital processing unit. These data are supplied to the image forming device to produce a color image.\n\nIn this conventional process, the image quality and output gradations depend heavily on the settings of the scanner, digital processing unit, and image forming device. The color reproduction accuracy is influenced by the image input conditions, the characteristics of the color reproduction system, and the image processing methods. The color reproduction accuracy can be further improved by calibrating the input data, the color reproduction system, and the image processing methods.\n\nHowever, these conventional techniques require complex calibration procedures, which are time-consuming and may result in inaccuracies due to human error. Additionally, the calibration process must be repeated periodically as the color reproduction system's characteristics and image processing methods may change over time.\n\nThe present invention seeks to overcome these limitations by providing a method and apparatus for automatically adjusting the output gradations of an image output apparatus. This invention comprises a gradation correction curve, which is a graphical representation of the relationship between input data and output data. The gradation correction curve can be generated by using a training set of input data and corresponding output data, which can be obtained by analyzing a large number of previously produced images.\n\nThe image output apparatus incorporates a gradation correction unit, which is responsible for comparing the input data to the gradation correction curve and adjusting the output gradations accordingly. The gradation correction unit uses an optimization algorithm to minimize the difference between the input data and the output data that matches the gradation correction curve. This ensures that the output gradations closely resemble the original image, thereby improving the overall image quality.\n\nFurthermore, the gradation correction curve can be dynamically updated based on new data collected from produced images. This allows the image output apparatus to continuously adapt to any changes in the input data or image processing methods, ensuring consistent image quality and output gradations.\n\nIn conclusion, the present invention offers a significant improvement over existing technologies by providing an automated method and apparatus for adjusting the output gradations of an image output apparatus. This results in improved image quality, consistent output gradations, and reduced dependence on manual calibration procedures.",

    "However, closedness depends on the containing space as you mentioned earlier in your example with set F. In other words, being closed or not can change when we consider a different ambient topological space that contains our original subset A of X (or B of Y). This is why some mathematicians prefer to use \"closed\" only for subsets within specific spaces and reserve the term \"set\" more generally.\nIn fact, in point-set Topology which deals with properties related solely to a set itself without considering its embedding into any larger space (as opposed to general topological concepts that require some ambient context), closedness does not appear as an important concept since every subset of such spaces is already considered \"closed\" by default. In this sense, compact sets are more fundamental and have been extensively studied in various branches of mathematics including functional analysis, algebraic geometry, number theory, probability theory etc., while the notion of being closed has a limited role beyond topological space contexts (such as linear spaces or metric spaces).\nSo to answer your question: While both concepts are related through their importance for understanding different types of mathematical structures and phenomena in various settings, compactness is more intrinsic than closeness.",

    "The effect of the proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole (EZ) on the oral absorption and pharmacokinetics of nilotinib (NIB) was evaluated in healthy participants to evaluate its impact on NIB's bioavailability. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned into two groups: Group 1 received esomeprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor with higher solubility at lower pH values compared to NIB (40 mg once daily from day 8 to 13), while the other group (Group 2) was given placebo. Blood samples were collected on days 7 and 15 for both groups, and plasma concentrations of NIB were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-UV). Plasma to drug ratio values were calculated as the percentage of esomeprazole inhibition. The pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated included AUC0-24h, Cmax, T1/2 and AUC0-84 hours, which are used for evaluating absorption rate, maximum plasma concentration, time to reach half the maximum concentration, and 95% of total dose clearance respectively. The results showed that there was no significant difference in any pharmacokinetic parameter between groups (p>0.05), indicating a lack of impact by esomeprazole on NIB's absorption and distribution to the liver or intestine, as well as its bioavailability. However, participants who received placebo had higher plasma concentrations compared with those given nilotinib (Cmax: Group 1 - mean(732 ng/mL) vs. Group 2-mean(458 ng/ml), p<0.05). In conclusion, esomeprazole did not significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of NIB in healthy participants and its bioavailability, but it may have a positive effect on the absorption rate by increasing the solubility of nilotinib at higher pH values.",

    "ial movements and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) sounds were assessed preoperatively and at regular follow-up intervals postoperatively. Radiological evaluations included panoramic radiographs, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging to analyze the fracture patterns, reduction quality, plate positioning, and hardware stability over time.\n\nThe results demonstrated that this combined approach of retromandibular transparotid access with triangular-positioned double miniplate osteosynthesis provided a high rate of anatomical reduction (95%) and stable internal fixation in the majority of cases, leading to satisfactory functional outcomes. The mean maximal interincisal distance significantly improved postoperatively compared to preoperative values, indicating successful realignment of dental occlusion.\n\nDeviations/deflections were observed in 10% of patients at initial assessment but resolved within six months following surgery for the majority (85%) due to remodeling and healing processes. Facial movements returned close to normal ranges postoperatively without significant restrictions or discomfort, demonstrating successful preservation of TMJ function.\n\nRadiological evaluations revealed excellent hardware stability over time with no signs of loosening, breakage, or migration in any cases. This finding suggests that the double miniplate osteosynthesis technique provides adequate mechanical support for fracture healing and maintains its efficacy long term. Additionally, there were no significant complications such as infection, plate exposure, or neurological deficit associated with the retromandibular transparotid approach used in this study.\n\nIn conclusion, our clinical and radiological evaluation of 124 mandibular condyle fractures treated using a combination of retromandibular anterior transparotid access and triangular-positioned double miniplate osteosynthesis demonstrates its safety, efficacy, and durability in achieving anatomical reduction, stable fixation, and satisfactory functional outcomes. This surgical technique may be considered as a viable option for the treatment of mandibular condyle fractures with potential benefits over other modalities based on our findings. However, further research involving larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods is necessary to confirm these results and establish this approach as the gold standard in managing such injuries.",

It automatically deallocates or frees up space in heap memory occupied by objects that are not used (not referenced) anymore, thereby making the unused/free memory available for use again. This helps to prevent memory leaks and optimizes performance as it reclaims memory from old instances which can no longer be accessed through any references within your program's scope.\n\nHowever, if you still have a reference elsewhere in your code (like another list or an individual variable), the garbage collector won\u2019t remove that object because Java sees this remaining reference and considers it necessary for further use of memory space by your application. \n\nSo to answer your question directly: Yes, removing objects from ArrayList using `remove(int index)` method does invoke Garbage Collection if there are no other references pointing towards the removed elements within your program's scope.",
    "aigns by arguing that a coalition between the two parties could help to rejuvenate British politics and promote progressive policies.\n\nHowever, events since May 2010 have changed my mind on this issue significantly. The Coalition Government formed after the general election saw the Liberal Democrats enter into an alliance with the Conservative Party - not Labour as many had predicted or hoped for. This arrangement has proven to be a disaster for both parties and particularly so for the Lib Dems, who have been forced to swallow some deeply unpalatable policies in exchange for little tangible benefit.\n\nThe most glaring example of this is undoubtedly the expansion of university tuition fees. The Liberal Democrats had campaigned vigorously against such a move during the election and even included it as part of their official manifesto pledge, promising to oppose any increase in fees if they entered into government. Yet once in power, under pressure from the Conservatives, they broke this promise and supported an unprecedented rise in tuition costs for higher education students - a move that has deeply alienated many former supporters and tarnished their reputation as champions of social justice and equality.\n\nMoreover, it is not just on issues like university fees where the Lib Dems have appeared to compromise principle for political expediency within this coalition government. On matters ranging from welfare reform, taxation policy, foreign interventionism in places such as Libya - there seems little evidence of any significant influence exerted by their party beyond token gestures or minor concessions that do not fundamentally alter the Conservative agenda.\n\nIn light of these developments, it is difficult to see how continuing co-operation between Labour and the Liberal Democrats would be beneficial for either side at present. The Lib Dems have shown themselves incapable of standing up against their coalition partners when push comes to shove; they appear more interested in clinging onto power than staying true to their stated ideals.\n\nAs such, it is time that both Labour and the Liberal Democrats accept reality: this particular partnership has run its course and should be allowed to wither away rather than being artificially propped up for political convenience or expediency. For Labour, focusing on rebuilding trust among traditional supporters while developing a clear vision of their own policies without reliance upon coalition partners would likely prove more fruitful in the long term; similarly, the Liberal Democrats need space to regroup and reassess what they stand for beyond merely being 'the other party' within Westminster politics.\n\nIn conclusion, let us allow the Lib Dems to stew in their current predicament - a situation largely of their own making due to poor judgment calls during coalition negotiations back in 2010. Both parties would benefit from taking stock and refocusing on core principles rather than pursuing short-term alliances that ultimately undermine those very ideals they claim to uphold.\"",

    "encompasses several key elements that set it apart from other forms of Catholic education. \n\nFirstly, there is the deep-seated commitment to serving those most in need through an unyielding dedication to social justice initiatives. This element calls on educators and students alike to recognize their role as stewards of society, actively promoting equitable change within communities that are often overlooked or marginalized by mainstream efforts.\n\nSecondly, Lasallian spirituality emphasizes the importance of fostering a nurturing environment where every individual can thrive academically, spiritually, emotionally, and socially - an approach encapsulated in what is known as \"One to One Policy\" which ensures personal attention for each student's growth. This aspect encourages mutual respect between teachers and learners, promoting not just academic excellence but also holistic development of the person.\n\nThirdly, there exists a profound appreciation for collaborative community-building within Lasallian institutions. Emphasizing teamwork among faculty members as well as students reinforces strong bonds that are essential in creating an inclusive atmosphere where everyone feels valued and heard - contributing significantly to personal growth while promoting shared learning experiences.\n\nMoreover, this form of Catholic education also places great value on continual self-improvement or \"ongoing formation\" for both educators and learners. It promotes life-long learning practices encouraging individuals not only to acquire knowledge but more importantly develop skills necessary towards becoming responsible citizens capable of contributing positively to their respective societies. \n\nLastly, perhaps one of the most distinctive features is its adaptability. Despite being grounded in centuries' old traditions stemming from Saint John Baptist De La Salle himself, Lasallian spirituality remains agile enough to respond effectively to contemporary challenges and opportunities faced by modern educational systems worldwide - proving remarkably resilient across different cultures and contexts.\n\nIn essence then, what sets apart the Catholic religion's work within higher education institutions like Saint Mary\u2019s College is this unique blend of social justice advocacy, personalized care for holistic development, collaborative community-building efforts, emphasis on continuous improvement, coupled with remarkable adaptability - all underpinned by strong spiritual foundations. These elements collectively form 'the extra added something' that gives a distinctive edge to Lasallian education within the broader landscape of Catholic faith-based institutions globally.<|im_end|><|im_end|>$\n</s><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|>",

    "s explain further on why we have a canonical isomorphism between the tensor product and the direct sum, and what role does this map $\\phi$ play in the proof? \n\nThe given statement of Prop 1.5.d provides an explicit formula for how to construct a bilinear map from the external direct product (i.e., Cartesian product) $(M_i \\times N)_{i\\in I}$ into the tensor product $\\left(\\oplus_{i\\in I} M_i\\right)\\otimes A N$.\n\nThe proof starts by defining an isomorphism $\\phi :(M_i \\times N)_{i\\in I}\\to (\\oplus_{i\\in I}(M_i \\otimes _A N))$ between the external direct product of Cartesian products and tensor products. This map $\\phi$, which sends $(x,y)$ to $(\\sum_{i} (xi \\otimes y), the sum being over all i in I$.\n\nThe key step is then to show that every bilinear form on $M_i\\times N$ can be factored through this particular map. In other words, if we have a linear function F from $(M_i \\times N)_{i\\in I}$ into some module L, it can be uniquely decomposed as the composition of two functions: one that takes an element (xi , y) in $M_i\\times N$ to xi \u2297 y in $(\\oplus_{i}( M_i \\otimes _A N)$, and another function from this latter module into L.\n\nThis decomposition property is a fundamental result of linear algebra, often called the Universal Property of Tensor Products or Direct Sums: they are unique up to an isomorphism that respects bilinear forms (or multilinear forms in higher-dimensional cases). The proof thus shows not only the existence but also uniqueness of such factorizations.\n\nThe symbol 'Hence' is used here as a conclusion derived from the preceding arguments, and it indicates why we have the stated canonical isomorphism between tensor product and direct sum modules. It suggests that since every bilinear map can be factored through this particular function $\\phi$, then this must indeed give us an isomorphic representation of our original space under these operations.",

    ". However, there are a few things to consider when setting the session timeout in ASP.NET. Firstly, if your application is using InProc mode for sessions (default), then the session state will be stored in the same process as your web application and can only last as long as that process remains running. Setting it to 1 minute may not work as expected because IIS could recycle your app pool after some time due to various reasons like resource utilization, idle timeout etc., which would reset all session state data.\n\nIn order to store the sessions in a separate server (StateServer or SQL Server mode), you can enable either of these by changing the \"mode\" attribute in your web.config file:\n```xml\n<system.web>\n  <sessionState mode=\"StateServer\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"1\"/>\n</system.web>\n```\nor for SQL Server mode:\n```xml\n<connectionStrings>\n    <!-- Define your connection string here -->\n</connectionStrings>\n<sessionState mode=\"SQLServer\" sqlConnectionString=\"your_sqlserver_connection_string\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"1\"/>\n```\nKeep in mind that if you are using SQL Server mode, make sure to provide a valid `sqlConnectionString`, and your application user should have permissions on the specified database.\n\nPlease also note that setting session timeouts too low may cause unnecessary overhead for storing and retrieving sessions from server memory or storage frequently, which could affect performance of your web applications. 1 minute might be suitable if you are testing something specific but it's recommended to use a higher value in production environments unless there is a particular reason not to do so.",
    "modifications to improve efficiency and specificity, will be discussed first. Then, the potential applications of retroviral gene transfer for therapeutic purposes in various types of cancer will be explored. Finally, a brief overview of current challenges faced by this methodology will also be provided.\n\nRetroviruses are RNA viruses that contain single-stranded linear genomes with long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends, which facilitate reverse transcription into double-stranded DNA upon infection. This process leads to the integration of the retroviral cDNA into the host genome via a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Once integrated, the viral genes are expressed by the cellular machinery, resulting in virus production and spread to neighboring cells.\n\nRetroviral vectors can be derived from various types of retroviruses such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These vectors are designed by replacing the viral genes involved in replication with therapeutic transgenes under control of a strong promoter, while retaining essential structural components required for integration and expression. The choice of vector depends on factors like safety profile, capacity to accommodate foreign DNA, target tissue tropism, and production efficiency.\n\nOne common strategy to enhance the specificity of these vectors is by using recombinant viruses that specifically infect dividing cells or modifying the promoters driving transgene expression to ensure it only occurs in desired cell types. Moreover, pseudotyping retroviral particles with envelope proteins from other virus families allows for increased target range and tropism.\n\nThe potential applications of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer are vast in cancer therapy due to their ability to integrate the therapeutic genes into the host genome. This can result in long-term, stable expression of antigens that stimulate immune responses or production of substances like cytokines that inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Some examples include:\n1) Oncolytic therapy: retroviral vectors containing genes encoding for enzymes disrupting viral replication in cancer cells can selectively kill them, while leaving healthy tissues unharmed. Examples of these therapies are the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which is modified to express a gene that triggers cell death only when HSV protein synthesis occurs at high levels inside rapidly dividing cancer cells.\n2) Immunotherapy: introducing genes encoding for immune stimulatory molecules can enhance anti-tumor immunity, as seen with interleukin (IL)-12 or IL-15 that activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cell responses against tumors.\n3) Genetic correction: delivering corrective genes to fix mutated ones in inherited cancers like retinoblastoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and others has shown potential for prevention of cancer onset or progression. \n\nDespite its advantages, there are several challenges that need addressing before implementing retroviral gene transfer as a routine therapeutic strategy: the risk of insertional mutagenesis due to random integration can lead to new tumors; immune response against vector components may limit transduction efficiency and repeat administrations could be needed for sustained expression. Moreover, targeting specific tissues or cell types remains difficult, especially in solid tumor contexts with a heterogeneous cell population.\n\nIn conclusion, while retroviral vectors have shown significant promise as tools for gene therapy in cancer patients through various applications like oncolytic viruses and immunotherapeutic strategies, further research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with random integration into host DNA, immune response against vector components, and achieving efficient targeting of specific tissues or cell types.",

    "lative to the spindle. This causes the helical formation on the spindle to rotate, which in turn drives the potentiometer connected to it. The output of the potentiometer can then be transmitted via wiring or wireless means to a remote location for control purposes or displaying the piston position within the cylinder.\n\nThis design provides several advantages over traditional mechanical systems used for measuring displacement. Firstly, because the spindle is connected through a friction clutch with a rotary potentiometer, it allows continuous and precise measurement of axial displacement without any significant wear or maintenance requirements on moving parts such as gears or linkages.\n\nAdditionally, since there are no direct physical connections between the piston rod and the remote control or display system, this design is less susceptible to shock loads that could cause damage or inaccuracies within mechanical systems. This makes it particularly well-suited for use in mining applications where equipment may experience sudden impacts from rock falls or other hazards.\n\nOverall, positioning cylinder assemblies with a helical formation on the spindle connected to a rotary potentiometer offer increased accuracy and reliability compared to traditional systems while also providing resistance against shock loads commonly encountered in mining operations. This makes them an ideal solution for many different applications within the industry, from controlling tool advancement or implement stroke, properly positioning props or any other purpose requiring precise measurement of piston displacement within a cylinder assembly.",

    "donk, with their final moments marked by the brutal irony of the medieval fortress's walls that once protected the city now serving as a grim backdrop for the loss of innocent lives. The exterior of the fort, with its towering gray walls and imposing turrets, stands as a haunting reminder of the dark past it harbored during World War II. The once-impregnable fortification was transformed into a horrific concentration camp, a testament to the darkness that human cruelty can reach.\n\nIn the years following the war, the Belgian government converted Fort Breendonk into a museum, serving as an essential educational tool for generations to come. Visitors are now able to walk the same grounds that held prisoners under the rule of the Nazi regime, witnessing firsthand the conditions in which the inmates lived, suffered, and died.\n\nThe exterior of Fort Breendonk is a solemn and sobering sight, one that is hard to look upon without experiencing a deep sense of grief and anger. As one stands outside the walls, it's essential to remember the suffering that took place within, the resilience of those who survived, and the unwavering commitment to ensure that such atrocities never happen again.\n\nThe legacy of Fort Breendonk serves as a potent symbol of the human capacity for both immense cruelty and extraordinary courage. By maintaining the fort as a museum, the memory of the victims and survivors is preserved, serving as a lesson for future generations to stand against hatred and oppression.\n\nAs the sun sets on the once-feared fort, its exterior is cast in long shadows, a haunting reminder of the history that unfolded within its walls. It's a place where silence speaks volumes, where the stories of the inmates echo through the air, and where the importance of peace, tolerance, and unity is made abundantly clear.",
    "ns issue. To make the HMVC modules work in CodeIgniter, you need to follow a few additional steps. First, make sure you have properly loaded the HMVC class in your CodeIgniter's autoload.php file, under the system/config folder. It should be loaded in the 'classes' section like this:\n\n`$autoload['classes'] = array('database', 'session', 'form_validation', 'parser', 'email', 'security', 'table', 'encrypt', 'MX', 'Cart', 'Captcha', 'MX_CodeIgniter_Ion_Auth', 'MX_Google_Authenticator', 'MX_Lang', 'MX_Controller');`\n\nAlso, make sure you have replaced the default MY_Controller.php in application/core with the one provided by HMVC. This class serves as a base class for all your modules' controllers.\n\nNow, you need to update the $autoload['helper'] array in the autoload.php file to include the 'url_helper'. This helper is used to generate module-specific URLs.\n\nAfter these changes, you should be able to access your module by navigating to the URL localhost/index.php/test. If you still see the \"Page Not Found\" error, double-check that your module's name (test) and the controller file (test.php) have the same name.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that your module's controller class name (Test) follows the naming convention for CodeIgniter controllers: starting with an uppercase letter.\n\nFinally, ensure that your module's config file (application/config/modules.php) has an entry for the test module, which should look like this:\n\n`$config['modules'] = array(\n    'test' => array(\n        'package' => 'test',\n        'subpackage' => '',\n        'version' => '1.0',\n        'priority' => 1000,\n        'directory' => 'modules/test',\n        'is_auto_loaded' => TRUE,\n        'filename' => 'test.php',\n    ),\n);`\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to access and use your HMVC modules in CodeIgniter without any issues.",

We designed a bipedicle island flap from the dorsum of the index finger to repair thumb defects. One pedicle includes the radial proper palmar digital artery (PDA) of the index finger, another pedicle includes the first dorsal metacarpal artery (FDMA). The aim of the study was to investigate the anatomical basis and clinical application of this flap.\n\nEleven fresh cadaver hands were dissected, and the FDMA and the radial proper PDA were exposed. Their origin, distribution, and diameter in different locations, especially in the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of the index finger, were examined.\n\nTen patients (11 hands) underwent thumb reconstruction using this flap. During follow-up, the flap survival and hand function were evaluated. The origin of the FDMA in three cadaver hands was abnormal. The FDMA was mainly distributed in the proximal area of the dorsum of the proximal phalanx. The radial proper PDA of the index finger formed one constant dorsal branch.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of metastatic bone disease (MBD), the frequency of intravenous (I.V.) bisphosphonate use and its impact on skeletal-related events (SREs), and opioid use. Patients diagnosed with MBD between 2000 and 2004 were identified using 2 Thomson MarketScan Research Databases. A total of 6783 patients, 1431 with breast cancer, fulfilled the criteria. Pain was assessed as the number of days on opioids, the strength of which was categorized according to the World Health Organization 3-step ladder for pain. Use of I.V. bisphosphonates steadily increased for all cancers from 17% in 2000 to 38% in 2004. For all patients, 61% received mild opioids and 35% received moderate to severe opioids at baseline. Use of I.V. bisphosphonates within the first 90 days after diagnosis of MBD was associated with a 63% decrease in SREs and reduction in use of moderate to severe opioids. Among patients with breast cancer, 10.6% received oral bisphosphonates before diagnosis of MBD, and 33.8% had pain at baseline. There was a 5.4% reduction in the use of moderate to severe opioids in patients with breast cancer who received I.V. bisphosphonates within the first 90 days after diagnosis of MBD. The study found that the use of I.V. bisphosphonates was associated with a significant reduction in SREs and opioid use in patients with metastatic bone disease, particularly in those with breast cancer.\"",
